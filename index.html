(My First Reader)</h2><p><p>The publication of <i>Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See? </i>and <i>Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See? </i>completes the bear book beginning reader series. Now, children can read all four books on their own in this special format. </p><p> With the important pre-reading concepts of rhyme, rhythm, and repetition, these picture books have long been used as beginning readers. The new 6 x 9 trim and classic beginning reader layout create a more "grown up" version to read by themselves. </p><p> Complete with a letter from master educator Laura Robb, and with fun reading activities added, these new versions of <i>Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?</i> and <i>Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See?</i> are certain to appeal to a new age group and find an even wider audience.<br><i>Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?</i> is a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p>Fans of Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle's <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> and <i>Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?</i> will be delighted to see another title in this lilting call and response series. Much like their earlier picture books, <i>Panda Bear</i> features a string of fine feathered (and furry and scaly) friends watching over each other. In this book, however, all the animals are endangered, from a swinging spider monkey to a strutting macaroni penguin (kids will get a kick out of that name!) to a splashing sea lion. Carle&#x2019;s trademark tissue paper collages will be as familiar--and welcome--as the text ("Whooping Crane, Whooping Crane, what do you see?" "I see a black panther strolling by me."); young readers will quickly get the hang of the rhythm and join right in. The book concludes on a hopeful note, with a dreaming child seeing the ten f! eatured animals "all wild and free--/ that&#x2019;s what I see!" Martin includes a note on endangered species that may spark concern and interest in older readers--our hope for these disappearing creatures.

Outnumbered by Al Qaeda fighters, Air Force Combat Controller John Chapman and a handful of Navy SEALs struggled to take the summit in a desperate bid to find a lost teammate. <br>Chapman, leading the charge, was gravely wounded in the initial assault. Believing he was dead, his SEAL leader ordered a retreat. Chapman regained consciousness alone, with the enemy closing in on three sides.<br><br>John Chapman's subsequent display of incredible valor -- first saving the lives of his SEAL teammates and then, knowing he was mortally wounded, single-handedly engaging two dozen hardened fighters to save the lives of an incoming rescue squad -- posthumously earned him the Medal of Honor. Chapman is the first airman in nearly fifty years to be given the distinction reserved for America's greatest heroes.<br><br><i>Alone at Dawn</i> is also a behind-the-scenes look at the Air Force Combat Controllers: the world's deadliest and most versatile special operations force, whose members must not only exceed the qualifications of Navy SEAL and Army Delta Force teams but also act with sharp decisiveness and deft precision -- even in the face of life-threatening danger.<br><br>Drawing from firsthand accounts, classified documents, dramatic video footage, and extensive interviews with leaders and survivors of the operation, <i>Alone at Dawn</i> is the story of an extraordinary man's brave last stand and the brotherhood that forged him.<br><br></p><p>A 30-year special operations and Combat Control veteran, <b>Dan Schilling </b>has numerous combat and clandestine deployments around the world, including the operation popularly known as Black Hawk Down where he is credited with saving the lives of a Ranger and SEAL under fire. He later founded and then served as the first commander of two special operations squadrons. An adrenaline enthusiast, he holds the Guinness world record for most BASE jumps in 24 hours (201), is a mountain speedwing pilot and ski instructor at Wasatch Adaptive Sports, helping those with challenges gain independence through skiing. He and his wife live in the alpine town of Alta, Utah.

She was a longtime advocate for his Medal of Honor and is proud to share the story of her brother, who stood out from the ordinary long before he ever put on a uniform. Lori, her husband, and son, John, live in the "forever west" town of Cheyenne, Wyoming."The men who wear the Medal of Honor do so on behalf of all Americans-past, present, and future-who serve their country. I'm certain that if John Chapman had survived the events that led to his Medal, he would be uncomfortable with being singled out as a hero. But the fact is, that day he saved many lives at the cost of his own, and dozens of families owe the safe return of their loved ones to him. Every American should know this story. Thanks to <i>Alone at Dawn</i>, the first comprehensive account of his one man stand in Afghanistan, we have a chance to celebrate John Chapman's life and the courageous work of his fellow Air Force Combat Controllers."&#x2015;<b><i>Clinton Romesha, Medal of Honor recipient and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Red Platoon</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Alone at Dawn</i> is a stunning portrayal of a true American hero, from an unknown unit of unsung acclaim, and consisting of unassuming patriots. John Chapman, Medal of Honor recipient, exemplifies all the traits of the most decorated wing in the U.S. Air Force."&#x2015;<b><i>Lt. Gen. Kurt A. Cichowski, USAF (Ret), former Assistant Director, CIA</i></b><br><br>"A blend of military history, wartime drama, and the incredible true story of Sergeant John Chapman-the first Air Force Medal of Honor recipient since the Vietnam War-<i>Alone at Dawn</i> delivers blood-pumping action, heart-warming kindness, and an insider account of the most courageous individuals on the planet. Dan Schilling makes epic military heroism come alive and reminds us what true purpose is all about; and Lori Longfritz, John's sister, offers a poignant perspective on her brother's life, which was extraordinary long before his heroic one-man stand."&#x2015;<b><i>Deborah Lee James, 23rd secretary of the US Air Force</i></b><br><br>"<i>Alone at Dawn</i> is riveting and powerful. This stunning account reveals for the first time one of the most extraordinary acts of valor and courage in the annals of U.S. history. With this book, USAF CCT John Chapman now rightfully takes his place as an iconic hero of the Afghanistan War. All Americans should honor and enshrine the memory of such undaunted self-sacrifice and valor."&#x2015;<b><i>Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, USA (Ret.), author of <i>On Killing</i>, <i>On Combat</i>, and<i> Assassination Generation</i></i></b><br><br>"A long-overdue account not just of one hero but an entire force of heroes. Documenting Chapman's final mission, Schilling and Longfritz recreate the blood-soaked, desperate battle in all its dramatic detail, then fearlessly delineate the most terrible choice combat can demand. It's a story that will upset some and inspire many, but will leave no reader unchanged."&#x2015;<b><i>Jim DeFelice, coauthor of the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling <i>American Sniper</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Alone at Dawn </i>is inspired by the life and heroism of Medal of Honor recipient John Chapman. The genius of the book is that readers will also learn what a Combat Controller does, and why every team of Delta, SEALS, and Green Berets want their Air Force Special Tactics professionals with them whenever they engage in battle. The men on Takur Ghar, where seven Americans were killed in action in service to their country, were doomed by classic examples of senior military incompetence and inter-service rivalry. That terrible tragedy will never diminish the bravery of those who fought on and above the mountain in March of 2002, and those who made the ultimate sacrifice, especially MSgt John Chapman, USAF."&#x2015;<b><i>James G. Roche, 20th secretary of the Air Force</i></b><br><br>"A brave book about a brave warrior and the long overdue acknowledgment of the history and the contributions made by the men of the 24th Special Tactics Squadron (aka Air Force Combat Controllers)."&#x2015;<b><i>Pete Blaber, former commander Delta Force and author of <i>The Mission, The Men, and Me</i></i></b><br><br>"This is a story of heroism of not only of one man, John Chapman, but a heroic breed of American warriors-Air Force Combat Controllers. It is a gripping account of Chapman's last moments and pays homage to a brotherhood dedicated to keep America safe and free."&#x2015;<b><i>Dr. Robert Kadlec, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness &amp; Response, Former Deputy Staff Director, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Special Assistant to President George W. Bush</i></b><br><br>"As one of our nation's most elite special operations forces, Combat Controllers not only jump, dive, shoot, and maneuver with the best, they uniquely combine these skills with absolute mastery of three-dimensional battlespace to deliver lethal and precision airpower, making them the deadliest force on any battlefield. Among even this exceptional and select brotherhood, John Chapman's heroism on Takur Ghar is without equal in America's longest war."&#x2015;<b><i>Lt Gen Donny Wurster, USAF (ret), former commander, Air Force Special Operations Command</i></b><br><br>"The men who serve in Combat Control whose incredible story is presented in this book aren't asking for recognition. No late night talk show, video game or film could possibly begin to convey the intensity of the experience, the fear, the sense of duty and valor, the bonds that unite these men and, above all, the inner feelings and motivation of someone who has stepped up and accepted the challenge of this toughest of Missions."&#x2015;<b><i>Jeffrey "Skunk" Baxter, musician, national security specialist</i></b></p><h2>Abby&#39;s Pink Party (Sesame Street)</h2><p>Abby Cadabby is feeling blue because it's her birthday&#x2014;and no one remembered!

During the sweltering summer of 1964, more than seven hundred American college students descended upon segregated, reactionary Mississippi to register black voters and educate black children. On the night of their arrival, the worst fears of a race-torn nation were realized when three young men disappeared, thought to have been murdered by the Ku Klux Klan. Taking readers into the heart of these remarkable months, Freedom Summer shines new light on a critical moment of nascent change in America.<br><br>"Recreates the texture of that terrible yet rewarding summer with impressive verisimilitude." -<i>Washington Post</i></p><p>Bruce Watson is an award-winning journalist whose articles have been published in <b>Smithsonian</b>, <b>Los Angeles Times</b>, <b>Boston Globe</b>, <b>San Francisco Examiner</b>, <b>Yankee Magazine</b>, and <b>The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2003</b>.This powerful account of the Civil Rights Movement focuses on the volunteers that descended on Mississippi during the summer of 1964 for the purpose of registering black voters. David Drummond&#39;s narration, like Watson&#39;s story, starts strong and remains so throughout the entire production. Drummond provides a straight narration that proves to be sensitive and animated when the story requires. The combination of well-crafted reporting and Drummond&#39;s moving performance allows the listener to become a witness to a painful and tumultuous chapter in our nation&#39;s history. FREEDOM SUMMER will most certainly remain in the minds of listeners for some time.

Ideal for individuals and spiritual friends to use alone or with one another, &#34;Inviting Silence&#34; is a thoughtful primer on finding silence and a practical manual on meditation for seekers of every persuasion.</p><p><b>Gunilla Norris</b> is a meditation teacher and psychotherapist in private practice and the author of <i>Becoming Bread</i> and <i>Being Home</i>. She lives in Mystic, Connecticut.<br>A writer, therapist and meditation teacher, Norris pens an invitation and a challenge: be still. She writes for those who begin to experience spiritual yearning, as opposed to those who are already students somewhere along the spiritual path. As such, her instructions on beginning to meditate&#x2014;becoming acquainted with and comfortable in silence&#x2014;are simple and gradual. The material is logically organized, covering in friendly and flowing language what a beginner needs to know: Pay attention. Breathe. Sit up straight. Stick to it. Work with others to support a practice of silence. She rarely uses the term "meditate," as if that were too much spiritual jargon. This is paradoxically consistent with the best teachers of meditation, who know that the practice of paying attention is intended for everyday life as well as for the focused, intentional practice of meditation. A published poet, Norris chooses an evocative form for her words: a kind of spiritual blank verse, short unrhymed lines that themselves encourage slow reading and pausing to think and digest. ("In our present culture/silence is something like an endangered species....") This small, gift-sized book successfully gives a gentle nudge toward a demanding spiritual discipline. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Relates the perils of his childhood, both at home in Normandy and during his captivity at the court of France, and how at long last he came to embrace the values his father espoused. Suitable for ages 9 and up.</p><p>Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823&#x2013;1901), was an English novelist, known for her huge output, now mostly out of print. She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1853), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for forty years of The Monthly Packet, a magazine (founded in 1851) with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls (in later years it was addressed to a somewhat wider readership). Among the best known of her works are The Heir of Redclyffe, Heartsease, and The Daisy Chain. A Book of Golden Deeds is a collection of true stories of courage and self-sacrifice. She also wrote Cameos from English History, Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands and Hannah More. Her History of Christian Names was described as "the first serious attempt at tackling the subject" and as the standard work on names in the preface to the first edition of Withycombe's The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names, 1944. Her personal example and influence on her god-daughter, Alice Mary Coleridge, played a formative role in Coleridge's zeal for women's education and thus, indirectly, led to the foundation of Abbots Bromley School for Girls. After her death, her friend, assistant and collaborator, Christabel Coleridge, published the biographical Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters (1903).</p><h2>Honk That Horn!

In twelve years at the agency, he had never been so excited.</p><p>Taylor was the CIA&#x2019;s deputy chief of station for Istanbul. His dream job, his dream city. He&#x2019;d fallen for it backpacking across Europe at the end of the nineties. The last flash of American innocence, when taking a summer to drink cheap wine and run with the bulls still seemed adventurous. Taylor followed the usual route. He saw the sun rise over Montmartre, jumped off the rocks in Cinque Terre. He met his share of women. Always Americans. He never cracked European girls. Maybe if he hadn&#x2019;t tried so hard . . . He had fun. Yet he felt he&#x2019;d arrived a couple generations late. The cities were open-air museums. Even the beautiful couples walking along the Seine seemed to hold hands almost ironically. Like they were reenacting movies about Paris instead of living there.</p><p>Then he found Istanbul. Its history stretched millennia, and it was as picturesque as anyplace he&#x2019;d ever seen. Its giant mosques loomed over the Bosphorus, the mile-wide waterway that separated Asia and Europe. Yet it wasn&#x2019;t a museum. It teemed with life. Shopkeepers and students hustled along its hilly streets. Gleaming white yachts sped past packed ferries and rusted container ships. The Turks were hardworking and silver-tongued, loud and showy. Taylor had grown up in a stuffy town outside Boston. He liked them immediately. He even developed a soft spot for the devious shopkeepers in the Grand Bazaar. Those guys weren&#x2019;t exactly trying to take advantage, he decided. They wanted to deal. They wanted drama. Any tourist who didn&#x2019;t understand the game&#x2014;which every guidebook explained in detail&#x2014;deserved to be fleeced.</p><p>Taylor expected to be in the city three days. He stayed three weeks, flying home the afternoon before fall term started. He knew his sudden ardor was silly, but was falling for a city more absurd than falling for a woman? Both required a willingness to suspend disbelief. Anyway, now he had what every college student wanted. A goal, and a path to reach it. He would learn Turkish, move to Istanbul after graduation. Turkey had eighty million people and a fast-growing economy. Big companies needed Americans who spoke the language. And the University of Massachusetts shared an excellent Turkish program with other colleges around Amherst. He expected his parents to push back. They didn&#x2019;t. Dad: It&#x2019;ll make you a lot more hirable than a history degree. Mom: I always wanted to live somewhere exotic. Turkish was tough, but Taylor worked hard. By the start of senior year, he was nearly fluent.</p><p>Then al-Qaeda attacked the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like his friends, Taylor was terrified and enraged and wanted revenge. Unlike them, he could help. Turkey shared borders with Iraq and Iran. The FSB, Mossad, and Revolutionary Guard all ran major stations in Istanbul. The CIA was badly outgunned. Just four agency officers spoke Turkish. By November, the agency had contacted language programs all over the country in search of candidates. With his 3.8 GPA and spotless background, Taylor jumped out. A recruiter invited him to Boston for a meet-and-greet. The remains of the World Trade Center were still smoldering. He never considered saying no.</p><p>And he had never regretted his decision&#x2014;not even during his ten-month posting to Iraq, when he&#x2019;d left the Green Zone only four times. He&#x2019;d spent most of his career at CIA stations in Istanbul and Ankara, the Turkish capital. Taylor knew he wasn&#x2019;t a star case officer. The stars worked in Beijing or Kabul or Moscow. But he was reliable, dedicated, and a good fit for Turkey. Though he had joined after September 11, Taylor was something of a throwback. He disliked drones, preferred old-school spying, the careful recruitment of agents from government and business. Guys who lived in mansions, not mud huts. His best sources were mid-level officers in the Turkish army, bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>So Taylor&#x2019;s career progressed, and his social life, too. He made a habit of American twenty-somethings who came to town on two-year stints for multinationals. He replaced them easily enough. His years with the agency had given him an appealing air of mystery. His apartment had a killer view of the Bosphorus. Plus he knew every restaurant in town, and he always picked up the check. Case officers had practically unlimited expense accounts. No accountant at Langley would question a two-hundred-dollar dinner for &#x201c;recruiting.&#x201d;</p><p>The CIA promoted Taylor to deputy chief of station in Istanbul on the eleventh anniversary of his hiring. He planned to stay three years, then head back to the United States. He was ready to settle down, have a family. He didn&#x2019;t think he would ever be a chief. Taylor still believed in the mission, that in some small way he protected the United States. But he supposed that he&#x2019;d become a careerist. September 11 had faded in his memory, along with everyone else&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then the letter arrived.</p><p>Almost half a year later, its details were etched in his mind. Noon on a Friday in early September. The consulate mostly empty as the long Labor Day weekend approached. Istanbul stuck in a heat wave, smoking like a kebab on a spit. Taylor&#x2019;s office was air-conditioned, of course, but through its narrow bulletproof windows the men on the streets looked sullen and irritable.</p><p>A knock on his door. His secretary, Alison. She carried an envelope, holding it by her fingertips. Like it was contaminated. Though the consulate scanned local mail for anthrax and other nasties. She handed it to him without a word.</p><p>It was addressed to Nelson Drew, Associate Director for Citizen Services, United States Consulate, Istanbul. Taylor&#x2019;s cover name and job. Inside, a single page of staccato laser-printed sentences.</p><p>&#x201c;Nelson.&#x201d; You are spy. CIA. Real name Brian Taylor. Speak Turk/ Farsi. I am Rev. Guard Colonel. &#x201c;Reza.&#x201d; I need to meet.</p><p>Gran Bazaar 6 Sep 3 p.m. Ethcon Carpet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor felt like he&#x2019;d gone to the doctor for a routine physical and been told he had an inoperable brain tumor. Impossible. The letter&#x2019;s plain white paper burned his fingers. You are spy . . . He couldn&#x2019;t be blown like this. But wishing wouldn&#x2019;t erase the words.</p><p>He handed the letter and envelope back to Alison. &#x201c;Make a copy for me, one for Martha.&#x201d; Martha Hunt, the bureau chief. &#x201c;Bag the original and the envelope. Try not to touch them, in case there&#x2019;re fingerprints.&#x201d;</p><p>Though he didn&#x2019;t expect forensic evidence. Whoever had sent this was smart. And knew much too much about him. That he worked for the agency. His real name. Even that he knew Farsi. He&#x2019;d learned the language working with Iranian exile groups in Ankara. He hadn&#x2019;t liked the exiles. Most just wanted to hang out in Turkey on the CIA&#x2019;s dime. They found excuses whenever Taylor proposed operations that would send them back into Iran. Still, every so often one had decent intel, so the agency tolerated them.</p><p>Now that work had bitten him. As he&#x2019;d assumed, some exiles were double agents spying for Iran. Still, he couldn&#x2019;t imagine how they&#x2019;d found his real name. He&#x2019;d been careful. But he&#x2019;d been stationed in Turkey for a long time. Probably the Guard had put the pieces together bit by bit. Finding the answer would be impossible. He&#x2019;d left Ankara four years before. The exiles had scattered. What mattered was that his cover was blown. What if the Guard knew where he lived? Part of him wanted to get on the first flight home.</p><p>But he knew he had to stay. The man who&#x2019;d written this letter could be an enormously valuable source. The United States was desperate to stop Iran&#x2019;s nuclear program. Washington had imposed sanctions and attacked the program covertly. Still, the Iranians hadn&#x2019;t quit. Policymakers badly needed to know how close Iran was to a bomb. But the United States had few agents anywhere in the Iranian government, and none in the Revolutionary Guard. Instead, the CIA and National Security Agency relied on their usual technical wizardry. But Iran had buried its enrichment facilities to keep them from satellites, drones, and radiological sniffers. Following a joint American and Israeli attack on their computer systems in 2009, Iran&#x2019;s scientists had removed the computers from their labs. They solved equations with calculators now, used plaster to model bomb designs. Still, they were making progress. After all, the American scientists at Los Alamos had designed the first bomb in the 1940s with slide rules and hand-drawn blueprints.</p><p>Without hard evidence, the United States could only speculate at Iran&#x2019;s capabilities and intentions. Some analysts thought Iran would finish its first bomb in less than a year. Others said five years was more likely. This Revolutionary Guard colonel might have the answers.</p><p>If he was real. And not luring Taylor into a trap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Martha Hunt was named Istanbul station chief four months after Taylor became deputy. She was two years younger than Taylor and didn&#x2019;t speak Turkish. But he didn&#x2019;t begrudge her the job. She had served three years in Kabul, two in Islamabad. When they disagreed, she was usually right. The fact that she was shockingly good-looking, tall and slim, with killer blue eyes, didn&#x2019;t hurt. He&#x2019;d never hit on her. He knew his league. She wasn&#x2019;t in it.</p><p>They met in the safe room beside her office. It had no windows and was swept weekly for bugs.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it, either,&#x201d; she said, as soon as he closed the door. </p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Martha.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For all the obvious reasons. Who sets a meet in the Grand Bazaar? Must be five thousand security cams in there. But you&#x2019;ve got to go.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t wait for him to agree. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a week. Let&#x2019;s use it. Get a camera to put eyes on the door. He&#x2019;s dressed wrong, looks like he&#x2019;s hiding a vest, you abort. He wants to blow himself up, not your problem. Meanwhile, you want to stay in the safehouse until this is done, I&#x2019;m fine with that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay put. Can&#x2019;t give up that view.&#x201d; No way would he let Hunt think he was scared.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a view? I hadn&#x2019;t heard.&#x201d; A joke. Taylor&#x2019;s apartment was a minor legend.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on over sometime, see for yourself.&#x201d; He snorted, so she&#x2019;d know he was kidding. Though he wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell you what. Get us inside the Iranian nuclear program and I will.&#x201d; She smiled a smile he&#x2019;d never seen before.</p><p>He spent twelve hours wondering if she was flirting. Until he realized what she&#x2019;d done. She&#x2019;d given him a tiny ambiguous signal to chew over. To take his mind off the letter. Taylor had heard some men weren&#x2019;t suckers for beautiful women. He&#x2019;d never met one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The week dragged. Taylor looked over his files from Ankara, but nobody jumped out as a possible double agent. The station&#x2019;s tech-support team&#x2014;two chubby guys named Dominick and Ronaldo&#x2014;placed a thumbnail camera to watch the front door of the carpet store. The same night a cleaning crew threw it away. Hunt and Taylor decided not to risk placing another.</p><p>Two days before the meeting, Taylor checked out the shop himself. It occupied expensive space a few feet from the domed square where the bazaar had begun five centuries before. Rather than traditional patterned carpets, it specialized in modern, brightly colored rugs. Under other circumstances, Taylor might have bought one. Instead, he wandered into a pipe store and watched Ethcon&#x2019;s entrance as he pretended interest in an overpriced meerschaum.</p><p>He&#x2019;d come early. The bazaar was almost empty. After a few minutes, the Ethcon clerk poked his head out to talk to his counterpart across the corridor. Taylor recognized his accent as from southeastern Turkey, near Iran. Probably a coincidence. Hundreds of thousands of the region&#x2019;s villagers had migrated to Istanbul. The letter writer had likely chosen Ethcon at random. The company didn&#x2019;t show up on agency databases, and when Taylor had checked its Turkish records he&#x2019;d found nothing suspicious. Taylor eavesdropped as the clerk talked about very little. Finally, he handed back the meerschaum and left, ignoring the curses the pipe store owner tossed at his back.</p><p>He spent that night staring at the Bosphorus. He hated the way this meeting had come together. Simply by showing up, he was confirming his identity to whoever had sent the letter. Plenty of terrorists, from al-Qaeda to Greek anarchists, would gladly take a CIA scalp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good night&#x2019;s sleep,&#x201d; Hunt said the next morning. </p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t all have your cheekbones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you take the day off, practice your shooting.&#x201d;</p><p>The agency had a deal with the Turkish army to let officers use a range at a base near Istanbul. As usual, she was ahead of him. Taylor hadn&#x2019;t fired his pistol in a year. A day shooting would help him relax and might save his life. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bazaar stretched across a dozen blocks in Sultanahmet, the heart of Istanbul&#x2019;s Old City. On Friday afternoon, Taylor sat at a nearby McDonald&#x2019;s, watching tourists and Turks slurp down Cokes against the late-summer heat. He wore a tiny receiver in his right ear for updates from the surveillance team, a baggy T-shirt to hide the pistol in his waistband. At 2:44, his receiver buzzed.</p><p>&#x201c;Pico One. Possible Gamma sighting. In the forest now.&#x201d; Taylor. He could no longer bear the plastic friendliness of the McDonald&#x2019;s. He shouldered his way to the bazaar&#x2019;s southeast entrance. Two minutes later, his earpiece buzzed again. &#x201c;Pico One. False alarm on that Gamma, unless he has three kids.&#x201d; Finally: &#x201c;Pico Two. Empty forest. No Gamma, no X-rays.&#x201d; Picos One and Two were the CIA team around the store. Gamma was the letter-writer, whoever he was. X-rays were a potential enemy team. X-rays almost certainly meant a trap. Reza would arrive alone if he was genuine.</p><p>At 2:55, Taylor entered the bazaar. Six minutes later, he reached the store. Pico One was gone, but Two stood down the corridor. He wore his Real Madrid cap backward, signaling to Taylor that the store was empty except for the clerk. Reza hadn&#x2019;t shown. Unless the clerk himself was Reza, a long shot.</p><p>Taylor walked inside. The Ethcon clerk was dark for a Turk, with oily black hair. He wore a T-shirt and jeans, both too tight to conceal a bomb. &#x201c;You are Mr. Nelson?&#x201d; Taylor controlled his surprise. The store was a single room, its only entrance the front door. Rugs were piled high along the walls. Nowhere for anyone to hide. Taylor took the bait. &#x201c;Nelson Drew, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>The clerk picked an envelope off his desk. &#x201c;Boy come yesterday, say you come to the store today, I give you this. He say you want many rugs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How old?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our rugs are new&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The boy. How old was the boy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten years, maybe.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Iranian?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Turk.&#x201d;</p><p>Reza had figured the agency would be watching the store. He had used a runner to get a letter into the store safely. Basic tradecraft. The clerk handed Taylor the envelope. NELSON was printed across the flap in black letters. Taylor tore it open, found a single sheet.</p><p>Tram to Cevizliba?g. Down stairs to gas station. Arrive by 3:30. ALONE.

Azuela's writing is sometimes racy and virile, sometimes poetic and subdued, but always in perfect accord with the mood and character of the story.</p><p>Mariano Azuela, the first of the "novelists of the Revolution," was born in Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco, Mexico, in 1873. He studied medicine in Guadalajara and returned to Lagos in 1909,where he began the practice of his profession. He began his writing career early; in 1896 he published <b>Impressions of a Student</b> in a weekly of Mexico City. This was followed by numerous sketches and short stories, and in 1911 by his first novel, <b>Andres Perez, maderista</b>.<p>Like most of the young Liberals, he supported Francisco I. Madero's uprising, which overthrew the dictatorship of Porfirio D�az, and in 1911 was made Director of Education of the State of Jalisco. After Madero's assassination, he joined the army of Pancho Villa as doctor, and his knowledge of the Revolution was acquired at firsthand. When the counterrevolutionary forces of Victoriano Huerta were temporarily triumphant, he emigrated to El Paso, Texas, where in 1915 he wrote <b>The Underdogs</b> (<b>Los de abajo</b>), which did not receive general recognition until 1924, when it was hailed as the novel of the Revolution.</p><p>Azuela was fundamentally a moralist, and his disappointment with the Revolution soon began to manifest itself. He had fought for a better Mexico; but he saw that while the Revolution had corrected certain injustices, it had given rise to others equally deplorable. When he saw the self-servers and the unprincipled turning his hopes for the redemption of the underprivileged of his country into a ladder to serve their own ends, his disillusionment was deep and often bitter. His later novels are marred at times by a savage sarcasm. During his later years, and until his death in 1952, he lived in Mexico City writing and practicing his profession among the poor.</p>Text: Spanish</p><h2>A Friendly Universe: Sayings to Inspire and Challenge You</h2><p><b>Internationally acclaimed bestselling author Byron Katie presents inspiring sayings in this beautiful work, which features illustrations by award-winning artist Hans Wilhelm</b><br>In this vibrant book of inspiring and challenging wisdom, Byron Katie offers powerful aphorisms that can change the lives of readers forever.

It is we who have gone out for a walk." --Meister Eckhart In <em>Coming Home to Your True Self,</em> Albert Haase invites you to return home--and shows you the way to get there. "Home," he writes, "is the sacrament of the present moment. It is only living right now, right here, that we discover our lives and this world awash in the grace of God." Using the story of the prodigal son to illustrate the far country of our false self and the way back home to our true self in Christ, Haase introduces us to the spiritual disciplines that can help us find the path home to the Father. Rich with insights from Haase's experience as a spiritual director, this is a book for the weary, the lost, the regretful and guilty--essentially, a book for us all. No matter how long you've walked, God is still home.</p><p>Albert Haase, O.F.M. (Ph.D., Fordham University; M.Div., Catholic Theological Union), is a popular preacher, spiritual director and co-host of the weekly show, "Spirit and Life," heard&nbsp;on RelevantRadio.com. He is also director of the International Institute for Clergy Formation (Seton Hall University). He is author of&nbsp;Living the Lord's Prayer: The Way of the Disciple, Instruments of Christ: Reflections on the Peace Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi, and Enkindled: Holy Spirit, Holy Gifts (with Bridget Haase, OSU).&nbsp;He is a former missionary to mainland China. Visit his web site at AlbertOFM.org"Haase's book provides a wonderful frame for the spiritual journey, a very helpful summary and collection of wisdom from the Christian tradition, as well as examples from Haase's own spiritual direction practice. Here is a book for the troubled, the lost, the weary, the regretful, the guilty, and the hopeful&#x2015;all who are longing to come home and to be at home with God, themselves, and others." (Douglas H. Gregg, Presence, December 2008)<br><br>"Highly recommended for anyone who longs for a deeper relationship with God and his/her neighbor." (John B. Shewmaker, Catholic Library World, December 2008)<br><br>"Haase very skillfully and with great reader friendliness offers today's Christ followers a lovely, gently presented compilation of ancient spiritual traditions written in contemporary style.

(Ruth Haley Barton, author of Sacred Rhythms)<br><br>"It occurred to me while reading this lovely book that Albert Haase is a wise and seasoned Christian man. It comes through in page after page. This book is informed, insightful and practical, everything you want a book on spirituality to be. Haase knows the subject so well that he writes from the inside, making it simple and clear. <em>Coming Home to Your True Self</em> made me want to do what the title says&#x2015;find my true self in God. But more than that, it helped me make progress to that end." (Gerald L. Sittser, author of A Grace Disguised and Water from a Deep Well)<br><br>"I believe <em>Coming Home to Your True Self</em> will be a significant blessing for those who hunger for a genuine spiritual journey." (From the foreword by M. Robert Mulholland Jr., author of Invitation to a Journey)<br><br>"Albert Haase has captured the simple essence of the spiritual life in this readable treatment that flows easily from Jesus' parable of the prodigal son. Illustrating his points with lively personal stories, Fr. Haase illuminates such classical spiritual terms as <em>detachment, discernment</em> and <em>penance,</em> making them live for the modern reader. He draws deeply on the teaching of Jesus and shows us how to 'come home' to our true selves. A fine guidebook for those who long for a deeper relationship with the Lord." (Emilie Griffin, author of Doors into Prayer: An Invitation)<br><br>"This is practical and profound spiritual guidance! If we do not clarify some of these foundational issues, there will be no real flourishing in our search for God. Albert Haase makes very substantial ideas readable, personal and even adventuresome. What a good Franciscan!" (Richard Rohr, O.F.M., Center for Action and Contemplation and author of Everything Belongs)<br><br>"Franciscan Albert Haase has done it again. <em>Coming Home to Your True Self</em> will receive a . . . warm reception from his readers, since it is steeped in the mystical tradition of the West from the Christian Scriptures to the desert dwellers of Egypt, and then through the Franciscans and the Dominicans, especially Meister Eckhart, which is becoming so popular with those seeking God in journeys of faith and love.

But the story of this spirited group of six southern women, who have been holding biannual reunions ever since they were together in college, is nothing short of compelling.<br><br> On an island every summer and in the mountains every fall, the Same Sweet Girls come together to share their stories. When one of the group faces the most difficult challenge of her life, the novel builds to an almost unbearably powerful conclusion, one of the most memorable in current fiction. Without a touch of sentimentality, Cassandra King writes of the way close friends can help each other through even the most cataclysmic life events. Both heartbreaking and hilarious, <em>The Same Sweet Girls</em> will touch, move, and inspire readers to cherish their own lifelong friendships.<br><br> Perfect for reading groups, <em>The Same Sweet Girls</em> is a story of friendship that readers will want to share with their special girlfriends.</p><p><strong>Cassandra King</strong> is the author of <em>The Sunday Wife</em>, <em>The Same Sweet Girls</em> and <em>Queen of Broken Hearts</em>. A native of Lower Alabama, she lives in the Low Country of South Carolina with her husband, novelist Pat Conroy.Patricia Kalember masterfully narrates this story of college pals who remain lifelong friends. She portrays each of the women, who voice alternating chapters, with gentle Georgia and Alabama accents, and perfectly characterizes "Miss Cotton" with an exaggerated drawl. As they help each other through abusive marriages, divorces, and illnesses, Kalember portrays their sorrows with touching emotion. She easily transitions to a lighter tone as the group reenacts its delightfully silly queen contest. She gives special attention to the author's directives, applying appropriately condescending airs to a couple of "holier than thou" characters and actually yawning on cue. Listeners will enjoy Kalember's strong performance as they applaud the growth and strength of the Same Sweet Girls.

While liberals of all stripes have held to some very basic values-liberty, individuality, and the critical use of intelligence-earlier forms of liberalism restricted the state function to protecting its citizens while allowing free reign to socioeconomic forces. But, as society matures, so must liberalism as it reaches out to redefine itself in a world where government must play a role in creating an environment in which citizens can achieve their potential. Dewey&#39;s advocacy of a positive role for government-a new liberalism-nevertheless finds him rejecting radical Marxists and fascists who would use violence and revolution rather than democratic methods to aid the citizenry.</p><p>John Dewey (1859-1952) authored more than two dozen books and scores of articles in both scholarly and popular publications. He rightly deserves the title of America&#39;s foremost philosopher and his work will influence intellectuals throughout the world for many years to come.</p><h2>Ecclesiastes (Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms)</h2><p>Respected Old Testament scholar Craig Bartholomew, coauthor of the well-received <i>Drama of Scripture</i>, provides a careful exegetical reading of Ecclesiastes in this addition to the Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms series. Along with helpful translation and commentary, <i>Ecclesiastes</i> considers the theological implications of the text and its literary, historical, and grammatical dimensions. Footnotes deal with many of the technical matters, allowing readers of varying levels of interest and training to read and profit from the commentary and to engage the biblical text at an appropriate level. Pastors, teachers, and all serious students of the Bible will find here an accessible commentary that will serve as an excellent resource for their study.</p><p>In this addition to the Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms series, Craig Bartholomew combines a careful exegetical reading of the book of Ecclesiastes with keen theological insights. The series is tailored to the distinctives of poetry and Wisdom literature, featuring emphasis on the message of the biblical book; special attention to poetic structure and literary devices; incisive comments based on the author's translation of the Hebrew text; exegetical rigor that incorporates linguistic, historical, and canonical insights; closing reflections on each section that explore the text's theological dimensions; and textual notes that highlight important features of the Hebrew text.<br><br>"Elegant and clear in presentation, with masterful control of the history of interpretation, Bartholomew has made a significant contribution to Ecclesiastes studies. He handles all the critical issues with care and insight and has given us a readable and penetrating portrayal of this enigmatic witness. A new standard."--<b>Christopher R. Seitz</b>, professor of biblical interpretation, University of Toronto, Wycliffe College<br><br>"Bartholomew provides an exegetically accurate, theologically sensitive, and culturally relevant reading of the enigmatic Qoheleth. For Bartholomew, Ecclesiastes is neither a dusty museum piece confined to ancient history nor an alien treatise limited to a past religious era. Instead, by combining the best historical, linguistic, literary, canonical, theological, and hermeneutical perspectives on this text, Bartholomew treats Ecclesiastes as a dynamic text that speaks powerfully into the (post)modern context of church and culture."--<b>Mark J. Boda</b>, professor of Old Testament, McMaster Divinity College, McMaster University<br><br>"It is a rare commentary that is both readable and learned. Even rarer is one that immerses readers in the deep questions of life. Bartholomew's new book helps us to think our way through Ecclesiastes and its mazes. More than that, it confronts us anew with the mystery and responsibility of human existence before the face of God."--<b>Raymond C. Van Leeuwen</b>, professor of biblical studies, Eastern University"Bartholomew has made a major breakthrough in providing an integrated, holistic reading that recognizes the tensions within the book but regards them as intentional. The author provides a dialogue between two opposing poles--a confessional one of Israelite wisdom whose starting point is God and an autonomous one based on Greek thought with a human starting point. The book lets both positions forcefully contradict each other throughout so that the weight of each can be felt and evaluated. Bartholomew writes creatively and passionately with full awareness of every major and minor work written on Ecclesiastes and has an excellent grasp of contemporary theological and philosophical currents. Calling it a welcome addition to the commentaries on Ecclesiastes would be to understate the significance of Bartholomew's work. I think it is a landmark!"--<b>Stephen Dempster</b>, Stuart E. Murray Associate Professor of Religious Studies, Atlantic Baptist University<br><br>"Bartholomew's commentary is an extraordinary achievement, in many ways a unique contribution to the vast literature on this enigmatic biblical book. It combines an intimate knowledge of the biblical text and the secondary literature on it with a passionate commitment to reading the text as Scripture, that is, the living voice of God to believers today. In addition, Bartholomew brings to his commentary a wide knowledge of the history of interpretation and of the hermeneutical issues involved in the appropriation of Ecclesiastes for today. Beyond these excellences, however, he also brings a prophetic awareness of the cultural and religious challenges facing the worldwide church today, and he is not afraid to make direct connections from the biblical text to the personal and global crises of our times.

It is significant as the only remaining contemporaneous resource that gives the full story of the origin and history of the Goths.

Clearly, invasive species are in the minority, but their small numbers don't keep them from causing billions of dollars in economic and ecological harm each year. Policymakers and ecologists continue to try to figure out which species might be harmful, which invasive species are doing the most damage, and which of these might respond best to eradication efforts. Invasive species reports and case studies are prevalent in political, environmental, and scientific news cycles, and a significant portion of the public is concerned about the issue. <br>In this book, Simberloff will first cover basic topics such as how non-native species are introduced, which areas have incurred the most biological invasions, and how the rates of biological invasions have shifted in recent years. He then moves on to the direct and indirect impacts of the impacts of invasive species on various ecosystems, such as habitat and resource competition, how invasive species transmit pathogens, and how introduced plants and animals can modify a habitat to favor other non-native species. Simberloff's final chapters will discuss the evolution of invasive species, the policies we currently have in place to manage them, and future prospects for controlling their spread. The book will also contain a section dedicated to the more controversial topics surrounding invasive species: invasive natives, useful non-native species, animal rights versus species rights, and non-native species' impacts on the biodiversity of an ecosystem.</p><p><p><b><em>WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW About This Series</em></b></p> <p><b>Who it's for:</b></p> <p> Busy people with diverse interests, ranging from college students to professionals, who wish to inform themselves in a succinct yet authoritative manner about a particular topic.</p> <p><b>What's inside:</b></p> <p>An incisive approach to a complex and timely issue, laid out in a straight-forward, question-and-answer format.</p> <p><b>Meet Our Authors</b></p> <p> Top experts in their given fields, ranging from an <i>Economist</i> correspondent to a director at the Council on Foreign Relations, you can trust our authors&#x2019; expertise and guidance.</p> <p><b>Popular Topics in the "<i>What Everyone Needs to Know</i>" Series</b></p> <ul> <li>International Politics</li> <li>Environmental Policies</li> <li>World History</li> <li>Sciences &amp; Math</li> <li>Religion &amp; Spirituality</li> </ul><br>Daniel Simberloff is Professor of Environmental Studies and Director of the Institute for Biological Invasions at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Adapted by Mike Poulton, the plays were premiered by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Swan Theatre, Straford-upon-Avon, in December 2013, directed by Jeremy Herrin.<br> This edition contains a substantial set of notes by Hilary Mantel on each of the principal characters, offering a unique insight into the plays and an invaluable resource to any theater companies wishing to stage them.<br> <i>Wolf Hall</i> begins in England in 1527. Henry has been King for almost twenty years and is desperate for a male heir; but Cardinal Wolsey cannot deliver the divorce he craves. Yet for a man with the right talents, this crisis could be an opportunity. Thomas Cromwell is a commoner who has risen in Wolsey's household&#x2015;and he will stop at nothing to secure the King's desires and advance his own ambitions.<br> In <i>Bring Up the Bodies</i>, the volatile Anne Boleyn is now Queen, her career seemingly entwined with that of Cromwell. But when the King begins to fall in love with plain Jane Seymour, the ever-pragmatic Cromwell must negotiate within an increasingly perilous Court to satisfy Henry, defend the nation, and above all, to secure his own rise in the world.</p></p><p><p><b>HILARY MANTEL</b> is the author of thirteen books.

Houston brings this world to wonderful life, showing how the myth of Isis and Osiris gives modern readers a design for the marriage of body and soul, life and death, the tangible and the hidden. In detailed exercises and dramatic enactments that can be done in groups or alone, she demonstrates how we can identify the Isis and Osiris that are seeking reunion in each of us. <br><br>The Passion of Isis and Osiris re-creates nothing less than a moment of Egyptian magic that allows us to enter a consciousness that is the gateway to transcendent love. This story of two spiritual soulmates still has resonance for us today, whether we are seeking to join the disparate parts of self or searching for a mate to bond with, soul to soul.</p><p><b>Jean Houston</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of many books, including&nbsp;<i>The Possible Human</i>, <i>The Search for the Beloved</i>, and&nbsp;<i>A Passion for the Possible</i>.

Houston retells the ancient story of Isis and Osiris, twins borne by the heavenly goddess, Nut. In interpreting hieroglyphic thought patterns, Houston draws numerous parallels between Egyptian myths and Old and New Testament stories. Participation in the myth journey is outlined in 14 steps that "coincide with 14 scattered parts of the broken body of Osiris and are symbolic of the process an individual goes through in reclaiming and reuniting the broken, scattered parts of a lifetime." The anticipated discovery is "that their stories are our stories" and as we understand how they dealt with their lives, we gain insight into ours. Recommended for religion collections.<br><i>Betty J.

But as she navigates the highs and lows of this strange new world, from life in a bustling quatier and surviving Parisian dinner parties to covering the haute couture fashion shows and discovering the hard way the paradoxes of France today, little by little Sarah falls under its spell: maddening, mysterious, and charged with that French specialty-s�duction.</p><p>An entertaining tale of being a fish out of water, Almost French is an enthralling read as Sarah Turnbull leads us on a magical tour of this seductive place-and culture-that has captured her heart</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><b>Sarah Turnbull</b>&nbsp;is the author of the international bestseller&nbsp;<i>Almost French</i>. She now lives in Sydney with her husband, Fr�d�ric.PROLOGUE <p>I left Australia hoping to cram a lifetime of adventures into one unforgettable year. Instead, I ended up with a new life. I&#x2019;d taken one year&#x2019;s leave from my job as a television reporter in Sydney to travel around Europe. If I didn&#x2019;t go now, I never would, warned a nagging voice in my head. Though, at twenty-seven I wasn&#x2019;t much interested in hanging around youth hostels. The idea was to immerse myself in fascinating foreign cultures, to work as a freelance journalist in Eastern Europe, which in my mind bubbled with unwritten, hard-hitting stories. </p><p>It was in Bucharest, Romania, that I met Fr�d�ric. His English was sprinkled with wonderful expressions like &#x2018;foot fingers&#x2019; instead of toes and he seemed charming, creative and complicated very French, in other words. When he&#x2019;d invited me to visit him in Paris, I&#x2019;d hesitated just long enough to make sure he was serious before saying yes. Why not? After all, this is what travelling is all about, isn&#x2019;t it: seizing opportunities, doing things you wouldn&#x2019;t normally do, being open to the accidental? </p><p>That trip to Paris was more than eight years ago now. And except for four months when I resumed my travels, I have been living here ever since. </p><p>It was a city and culture I was familiar with at least that&#x2019;s what I thought back then. When I was a child, my family had toured France in a tiny campervan and my eyes had popped at the chocolates and the cheeses. At secondary school I studied French and saw a few films by Truffaut and Resnais, which had struck me as enigmatic in a very European way, although I couldn&#x2019;t have said why. When I was sixteen we lived in England for a year and I came to Paris several times. In my mind, these experiences added up to knowledge of France and some understanding of its people. Then, a little over ten years later, my meeting with Fr�d�ric drew me back, and when the time came to actually live in Paris, I figured belonging and integrating would take merely a matter of months. </p><p>Now, remembering my early na�vet� draws a wry smile. The truth is, nearly all my preconceptions of France turned out to be false. It hardly needs to be said that living in a place is totally different from visiting it. And yet this blatantly obvious statement does need to be said, particularly about Paris, the most visited city in the world. A place I imagined to know after a few nights in a closet-size hotel room as a teenager and one summer holiday with a Frenchman sipping kir on caf� terraces.</p><p>At times the learning curve has seemed almost vertical. The social code I discovered in France wasn&#x2019;t just different from the one I knew, it was diametrically opposed to it. For a long time, I couldn&#x2019;t fathom the French and, to be fair, they couldn&#x2019;t fathom me either. My clothes, my smile even how much I drank set me apart. During my first year, dinner parties turned into tearful trials. There I was, a confident twenty-eight-year-old with the confidence knocked out of me, spending cheese courses locked in somebody&#x2019;s bathroom, mascara streaming down my cheeks.</p><p>It hasn&#x2019;t all been tears and trials, of course. The truth is, if France failed to live up to some of my expectations, in other ways the reality has been far richer, a thousand times better than my clich�d visions. My work as a journalist has enabled me to meet people ranging from famous French fashion designers to master chefs. On a personal level I&#x2019;d taken a headlong plunge into new territory as well. Put a very French Frenchman together with a strong-willed Sydney girl and the result is some fairly spectacular and sometimes hilarious cultural clashes.</p><p>If I had to pick one word to sum up my life in France, it&#x2019;d have to be "adventure." Every moment has been vivid, intensely felt. No doubt many people who live in a foreign country would say the same thing. But there is, I think, something that sets France apart from many other parts of the world. I know of no other country that is so fascinating yet so frustrating, so aware of the world and its place within it but at the same time utterly insular. A nation touched by nostalgia, with a past so great so marked by brilliance and achievement that French people today seem both enriched and burdened by it. France is like a maddening, moody lover who inspires emotional highs and lows. One minute it fills you with a rush of passion, the next you&#x2019;re full of fury, itching to smack the mouth of some sneering shopkeeper or smug civil servant. Yes, it&#x2019;s a love&#x2013;hate relationship. But it&#x2019;s charged with so much mystery, longing and that French speciality s�duction that we can&#x2019;t resist coming back for more.</p><p>From where I write in Paris today, I see a foil shimmer of rooftops, a few orange chimney pots, quaintly crooked windows and lots of sky. Although by this city&#x2019;s standards it&#x2019;s nothing special, to me it is precious, this view. It makes me think back to a time when we didn&#x2019;t have it, when we were living in a different apartment where I wasn&#x2019;t nearly as happy. Those early difficult years in France seem a lifetime ago now, as though they were lived by someone else. So much has changed since then, including me, probably. The truth is, when I started to write this book I had trouble taking myself back to that time. I don&#x2019;t know why it should have been so difficult. Either I&#x2019;d forgotten or subconsciously didn&#x2019;t want to remember or, being a journalist, I was paralyzed by the idea of writing in the first person. Probably a combination of all three.</p><p>For days and weeks, I sat staring at my rectangle of pearl gray sky. For inspiration I looked at old photos, read my early articles and Mum sent me all the letters I&#x2019;d written from France, which she&#x2019;d carefully kept. The memories came back gradually, growing sharper and brighter until I could see myself on that summer&#x2019;s day almost eight years ago, excited but nervous, arriving in Paris in my safari shorts and flat, clumpy sandals, oblivious to the horror my outfit would inspire in any self-respecting Frenchman.</p><p>And suddenly it seemed as though it had happened only yesterday. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Jerusalem's Queen: (A Biblical Ancient World Family Drama &amp; Romance) (The Silent Years)</h2><p>Born in the small village of Modein, a town made famous by the warrior Maccabees, Salome Alexandra knows better than to harbor grand dreams for her future.

Now Bury Us Upside Down reveals the never-before-told story of the Vietnam War&#x2019;s top-secret jet-fighter outfit&#x2013;an all-volunteer unit composed of truly extraordinary men who flew missions from which heroes are made.<br><br>In today&#x2019;s wars, computers, targeting pods, lasers, and precision-guided bombs help FAC (forward air controller) pilots identify and destroy targets from safe distances. But in the search for enemy traffic on the elusive Ho Chi Minh Trail, always risking enemy fire, capture, and death, pilots had to drop low enough to glimpse the telltale signs of movement such as suspicious dust on treetops or disappearing tire marks on a dirt road (indicating a hidden truck park). Written by an accomplished journalist and veteran, Bury Us Upside Down is the stunning story of these brave Americans, the men who flew in the covert Operation Commando Sabre&#x2013;or &#x201c;Misty&#x201d;&#x2013;the most innovative air operation of the war.<br><br>In missions that lasted for hours, the pilots of Misty flew zigzag patterns searching for enemy troops, vehicles, and weapons, without benefit of night-vision goggles, infrared devices, or other now common sensors. What they gained in exhilarating autonomy also cost them: of 157 pilots, 34 were shot down, 3 captured, and 7 killed. Here is a firsthand account of courage and technical mastery under fire. Here, too, is a tale of forbearance and loss, including the experience of the family of a missing Misty flier&#x2013;Howard K. Williams&#x2013;as they learn, after twenty-three years, that his remains have been found.<br><br>Now that bombs are smart and remote sensors are even smarter, the missions that the Mistys flew would now be considered no less than suicidal. Bury Us Upside Down reminds us that for some, such dangers simply came with the territory.</p><p>Rick Newman is a writer and editor at U.S. News &amp; World Report who covered the Pentagon for seven years, including U.S. missions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Persian Gulf.

In 2001 he joined CNN as one of their principal military analysts.Chapter one<br><br> &#x201c;MISSING MAN&#x201d;<br><br> The casket seemed like overkill. But it was too awkward for anybody to mention.<br><br> As seventy-five guests sat anxiously in the chapel at Arlington National Cemetery, the organist softly playing &#x201c;Amazing Grace,&#x201d; a military caisson clanked to a stop outside the gates. Pallbearers from the Air Force Honor Guard, every thread of their uniforms neatly in place, lowered a flag-draped coffin from the horse-drawn carriage. The men carried it up the steps and methodically marched it down the aisle, then set it before the small altar at the front of the chapel. The stiff, practiced precision of the pallbearers&#x2019; movements, their reverential bearing, all of the military formality&#x2014;it was impressive, to be sure. Yet it was starkly at odds with what was inside the casket: practically nothing.<br><br> In the second pew, Jean Kahoon grew uncomfortable as she listened to friends and colleagues eulogize Howard Keith Williams, her big brother. He had been shot down while flying an F-100 fighter jet over North Vietnam twenty-four years earlier and never heard from again. John Buckmelter, a childhood friend, described how Howard had fallen in love with flying when he was just a boy hanging out at the Jefferson County airfield near Steubenville, Ohio. Roger Williams, Howard&#x2019;s younger brother, described how pleased he had been to be able to go to Vietnam as an Army soldier at the same time Howard, his hero, had gone over to fly jets. Fellow pilots Roger Wise and Chuck O&#x2019;Connor told stories of going to flight school and learning how to be fighter jocks with &#x201c;Willy.&#x201d; &#x201c;He was always a little more focused, a little more mature,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Connor recalled.<br><br> But there was so much more to him, thought Jean, than his military career and his fascination with flying. There was the neighborhood sled-riding hill where she and her brother and dozens of other kids would go careening over rocks and bushes and have to jump off their sleds to avoid landing in the creek at the bottom. There were all the jobs Howard worked as a kid to pick up spending money and add to the family clothing fund: the paper routes, the lawns he mowed, the summer labor at their grandfather&#x2019;s farm in West Virginia where they&#x2019;d bale hay and plow up potatoes and milk cows. Best of all was the three-man band Howard helped form. He played trumpet and was good enough to get paying gigs at local nightclubs on weekends. In her mind, Jean could still see the drum majorette her brother had dated for a while in high school, the one with the great legs who wore her skirt so short it barely covered her panties.<br><br> Then there were all the special things between Jean and Howard, born two years apart and the oldest of eight children. Jean helped Howard deliver the papers and took over the route when he moved on to bigger jobs. She was with Howard at the farm in West Virginia when he tried chewing tobacco for the first time&#x2014;a short-lived habit. And all the nights they spent together hiding in the attic, talking and drawing, came cascading back. Their dad had been a carpenter for U.S. Steel, and he had been injured and out of work for a while. The family could afford just one upstairs bedroom for the girls, and one for the boys. But the setup had its charms. Each bedroom had a closet that led to a crawl space at the top of the house. That&#x2019;s where the family kept its supply of drawing paper&#x2014;blank newsprint that occasionally came bundled with the morning news. Jean and Howard would sneak up there once the younger kids were asleep and spend hours drawing cartoons and planning out the future. They&#x2019;d clamber back down to their beds once they heard their mom climbing the steps to check on the kids. Not once did they ever get caught&#x2014;not surprising, since Mom knew what they were up to all along.<br><br> And there, in a box twenty feet in front of her, Jean&#x2019;s big brother Howard, who caused her profound heartache when he left home and giddy joy whenever he came back to visit, had been literally reduced to shards: a bone fragment, one tooth, a sliver from a signal mirror that was part of his survival gear, and a piece of a plastic Ace comb. The remains, recovered by American investigators a year earlier, in 1991, were so sparse that Jean wondered, what&#x2019;s the point of putting them in a casket? She even had her doubts about whether they were actually Howard&#x2019;s. There had been so much that didn&#x2019;t make sense, so many fishy explanations, that it was hard to believe anything the government said.<br><br> Was it just coincidence that Howard had told her, in the last letter she ever got from him in Vietnam, that he was flying reconnaissance missions up north, taking pictures and getting shot at, and that he feared he might not make it home? Or that he wanted her to listen to a song that he said was about siblings like them&#x2014;&#x201c;Bang Bang, My Baby Shot Me Down&#x201d;? And how could the U.S. government not have known for twenty-three years what happened to Howard? That coffin, which contained her brother&#x2019;s so-called remains, was about as hollow as everything else the government had offered about her brother in the years since she had last heard from him.<br><br> Jean wasn&#x2019;t the only person in the chapel bothered by the contents of the casket. In the front row, Keith Williams&#x2014;Howard&#x2019;s son, who was six when his dad disappeared over North Vietnam&#x2014;had his own reservations. It was Keith who had flown to Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco when the remains were first returned to the United States, to &#x201c;escort&#x201d; them to the San Francisco airport. It seemed ridiculous to him that the Air Force had put a handful of body parts into a full-sized coffin. And he began wondering all over again how his father had died, and how much pain he had gone through. As Keith had gotten older, people who seemed to know such things had whispered to him horror stories about American pilots who had gone down in that part of North Vietnam, close to the border with Laos. Often they were murdered the moment they were discovered by local Vietnamese militias. Other times they were captured and tortured, only to die miserably before they ever made it to infamous prisons like the Hanoi Hilton. They were even shot at in their parachutes while descending. Those who got tangled in trees could be wounded and left hanging until they bled to death.<br><br> On the flight out to Travis, Keith had begun writing a eulogy on three-by-five-inch note cards, a eulogy he stood to give in the chapel at Arlington. Most of his recollections were the vaguest of sketches, filled in over the years by the stories he heard from friends and relatives and colleagues who had flown with his dad. So Keith described his dad largely as others had to him. He was &#x201c;a man whose love of life and family propelled him to excel in all of life&#x2019;s endeavors . . . As a self-taught artist, he shared with us his aesthetic ideal. . . . Music was another pastime my father pursued with dedication and single-mindedness. With a few songbooks, a tuning pipe, and hours of devotion, he brought laughter and joy to those who heard him play.&#x201d;<br><br> His true passion, however, had been flying: &#x201c;Diving, turning, zooming, and rolling amid the clouds allowed my father to push himself and his aircraft to the limits. Covering a mile every six seconds, my father was privy to a view of the world reserved for very few individuals. A world with no lines or boundaries between people or nations, with a crisp blue sky surrounding him, just on the edge of heaven.&#x201d;<br><br> Of those who spoke at the chapel that day, Keith Williams had known the man represented by the empty casket least of all. Yet the mere appearance of the son did more to animate the memory of the father than any words could have. Keith&#x2019;s lanky six-foot-two frame, his mannerisms and voice, his gentle face and slightly crooked smile&#x2014;almost everything about him, except the ponytail that hung over the collar of his dark suit&#x2014;made it seem as if Howard himself were standing at the lectern delivering his own eulogy.<br><br> From the fourth row of the chapel, Dick Rutan was struck by the resemblance. Competitive, excitable, and unflinchingly self-confident, Rutan fit the stereotype of a fighter pilot much better than the calm and studious man he was there to honor. In Commando Sabre, the top secret unit he and Howard had belonged to when Howard was shot down, Rutan was considered one of the most aggressive pilots&#x2014;and all of the pilots were aggressive. After Vietnam, Rutan had achieved aviation exploits that made him a legitimate celebrity, especially among the flight buffs in the pews around him. In December 1986 he and a female pilot, Jeana Yeager, had flown the Voyager aircraft completely around the world without ever stopping&#x2014;the first time anyone had made such an unrefueled, nonstop flight. The Voyager hung for the world to see just a few miles away, across the Potomac River, in the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s National Air and Space Museum.<br><br> Now, the fearless flight pioneer was uncharacteristically reserved. Rutan had been to dozens of funerals for colleagues killed in combat, yet this one punctured his emotional armor. He had last seen the lean young man at the lectern as a four- or five-year old, back when he and Howard were in training together. And now it was as if his old flying buddy were reincarnated and standing before him once again. If you have to leave the way Howie did, Rutan thought, it&#x2019;s good you can leave something like that behind.<br><br> But the vacant casket represented more to Rutan than just a lost flying buddy. It had been Rutan who had urged Howie, back in 1968, to join Commando Sabre, known informally by the radio call sign the unit used&#x2014;&#x201c;Misty.&#x201d; That came from the famous song by Johnny Mathis, which had been a favorite of the unit&#x2019;s first commander. Rutan and Howie had both been sent to Vietnam in 1967 to fly F-100 fighter-bombers on conventional missions in the South. Rutan had heard about Misty through back channels, and begged to join. The pilots would fly long missions over North Vietnam, looking for supply trucks and supplies and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and other mat�riel being shipped down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The pilots couldn&#x2019;t say much about the mission, which was just as well, because in one respect Misty sounded like suicide. To be able to find and direct strikes on targets that were expertly camouflaged, in mountainous jungle, the pilots had to fly so low they were fat targets for the North&#x2019;s antiaircraft guns. It was dangerous and exhausting work&#x2014;and probably the most exciting flying a fighter pilot could find in Vietnam.<br><br> Rutan got in and insisted that his friend Howie join the unit. Misty needed a hotshot like Howie, Rutan argued. His trademark calm in the cockpit was the perfect demeanor for the unit&#x2019;s stressful missions. And Howie&#x2019;s flight skills were unsurpassed. Howie had won the coveted &#x201c;Top Gun&#x201d; trophy in his F-100 class at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, nailing the highest scores in gunnery and bombing.<br><br> The allure was irresistible, and Howie volunteerd. Misty was happy to have him. He and Rutan both loved the freedom of flying with the unit. Unlike the tightly regimented operations in conventional squadrons, the Misty pilots flew as they saw fit in order to complete their missions, often making up their own rules. The outfit had renegade status and ruffled a lot of brass feathers. But it was a favorite of Gen. William &#x201c;Spike&#x201d; Momyer, the top Air Force general in Saigon, and the pilots pretty much got what they wanted. To Rutan, Misty was what war was supposed to be about: courageous men taking extraordinary risks, and receiving a few extraordinary privileges in return.<br><br> Dick Rutan and Howard Williams never got to fly together. Howie was shot down on his ninth mission. When Howie didn&#x2019;t return and was declared missing in action, the Misty commander appointed Rutan as summary courts officer, responsible for packing up Howie&#x2019;s stuff, paying his accounts at the officers club, and getting his other affairs and records squared away. That was always a devastating responsibility, made even tougher when Rutan later got a letter from Howie&#x2019;s wife, Monalee, back in Columbus, complaining that somebody had stolen Howie&#x2019;s Leica camera. The Air Force had told him to expect an angry letter like that&#x2014;&#x201c;anger transference,&#x201d; they called it&#x2014;but it was damned hard all the same.<br><br> Sitting in the chapel at Arlington, Rutan still felt guilty. But it had helped to see Monalee again, his first encounter with her since they had both been at Luke back in 1967. The hostility was long gone. She was now Monalee Meyers, and she sat in the front row of the chapel next to her husband Fritz, whom she had married in 1982. What she had gone through getting to that point, how tough it had been not knowing for years whether her husband was dead or alive while trying to explain to a growing boy what had happened to his dad, Rutan didn&#x2019;t know. He was simply relieved to see that she seemed stable and healthy and had everything under control.<br><br> Rutan also met Chuck O&#x2019;Connor and Roger Wise and some of Howie&#x2019;s other friends and family members. Another Misty pilot was there, too&#x2014;Brian Williams, known as &#x201c;B. Willy.&#x201d; He had been Howard&#x2019;s crewmate on March 18, 1968, when their plane went down. They all talked about what had happened. For some of the people at the ceremony, it was the first time they had heard the story of Howie&#x2019;s disappearance firsthand.<br><br> B. Willy had been in the back of the two-seat F-100, with Howie in the front, flying the jet, on a typical Misty mission scouting for targets along the Trail. It was about 11:30 in the morning on a clear day. They had just spotted what they thought was a North Vietnamese supply area and were turning around to go back for another look when they heard a loud thud and felt something hit the belly of the aircraft. A moment later B. Willy saw flames in his rearview mirror. Fire was spreading rapidly throughout the back of the plane and the pilots knew they&#x2019;d have to bail out. Howie aimed the plane toward high terrain, where there would be fewer enemy soldiers on the ground. Then they prepared to eject. &#x201c;We better get out!&#x201d; B. Willy had shouted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right behind you,&#x201d; Howie responded.</p><h2>All the Gallant Men: An American Sailor&#39;s Firsthand Account of Pearl Harbor</h2><p><p><strong>THE FIRST MEMOIR BY A USS&nbsp;<em>ARIZONA</em>&nbsp;SURVIVOR:&nbsp;Donald Stratton, one of the battleship's five living heroes, delivers an "epic,"*&nbsp;"powerful,"** and&nbsp;"intimate"** eyewitness&nbsp;account&nbsp;of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Pearl Harbor&nbsp;and&nbsp;his&nbsp;unforgettable return to the fight.&nbsp;A&nbsp;TOP-TEN&nbsp;<em>NEW YORK TIMES</em>&nbsp;BESTSELLER!</strong></p><p>At 8:06 a.m. on December 7, 1941, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton was consumed by an inferno.

By understanding evil as a very real force in the world, we are better able to name it for what it is and thus to combat it as Jesus did.</p><p>Beck's own work in a prison Bible study and at a church for recovering addicts convinced him to take Satan more seriously, and they provide compelling illustrations as he challenges the contemporaryand strangely safeversions of evil forces.

Beck leads a Bible study each week for inmates at a maximum security prison.<p>"Richard Beck is one of the most important and fascinating minds in contemporary Christianity, and this exploration on the devil and demons is his best work yet. Lively, engaging, and profoundly relevant, <i>Reviving Old Scratch</i> manages to both tickle and challenge, inform and delight. Beck forges a fresh way forward that avoids the conservative tendency to overspiritualize the devil and demons on the one hand and the progressive tendency to reduce these powerful forces to social issues on the other.

While I m not sure if I <i>believe</i> in spiritual warfare, I'm certain I've <i>experienced</i> it, and <i>Reviving Old Scratch</i> allowed me to come several steps closer to reconciling these seemingly irreconcilable statements.

Yet, as Richard Beck argues, this dismissal adversely affects both the coherence and the vibrancy of the Christian faith. In this insightful and highly important masterpiece, Beck helps Christians understand that they need not suspend their doubts about "Old Scratch" to discern his reality in the dark dehumanizing forces that are all around us. Whether you're convinced or doubtful of Satan's existence, this book will inspire you to enter into the age-long spiritual battle that has always been at the center of the Christian faith."</p><br>--Gregory A. Boyd, Author of <i>God at War</i> and <i>Satan and the Problem of Evil</i><br><p>"Richard Beck's <i>Reviving Old Scratch</i> will first put your theory of Satan and demons and the powers to death, then it will make you wonder if there isn't more than social justice and activism and believing in real, personal demons and angels, and then it will put a real Old Scratch with a mask onto what you thought was dead, and then you will be armed for the deeper battles of life and justice and love. Beck's prison ministry with people who suffer at the hands of Old Scratch evokes authentic spirituality in a way no other book about the powers has done."</p> --Scot McKnight, Northern Seminary<br><br><p>"In a world where it's awkward to talk about spiritual warfare, Richard Beck reminds us why it39;s still necessary, and he gives us words, images, and stories to start the conversation.

As we ponder the scene at the manger, however, I doubt many of us think about the impact that starry night had on those who were there. We don&#x2019;t often recall the slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem and their parents&#x2019; cries of agony. We also probably don&#x2019;t consider the dramatically changed lives of those humble shepherds who heard the angel&#x2019;s good news and who heard the heavenly host singing, &#x201c;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, toward men of good will.&#x201d; How those words must have rung in their ears many years after. How that sight of the infant Messiah must have never left their imagination.<br> <br> These first believers are the subject of an imaginative Christmas novel by Richard M. Barry, titled The Shepherds&#x2019; Prayer. The book tells the story of an adopted son with a mysterious connection to the Messiah, who seeks the truth about his birth thirty years later. The man, Anam, travels to Bethlehem, where contempt is apparent on the faces of the townspeople when they hear the name Jesus. Anam also meets a band of shepherds who gather at Bethlehem each year to celebrate what they witnessed upon the birth of Christ.<br> <br> The Shepherds&#x2019; Prayer is a story that reminds us of two things. First, we remember that the humble will be lifted up and confound the wisdom of the wise. ... Secondly, Barry&#x2019;s novel reminds us of perhaps how we often react to the difficult and painful circumstances in our lives. ... The shepherds who first believed in Jesus likely faced oppression and were treated as outcasts. Like them, we must maintain our faith regardless of the world&#x2019;s reaction. And we must never water down the message of Christ&#x2019;s birth.</p><p><p>Santa Claus. Beautifully wrapped gifts. Eating lots of good food with family and friends. For many, that's what Christmas is all about. But the author of a new book is determined to put the emphasis back where it belongs: on the birth of Jesus and how the Lord reinvigorates the lives of those who follow Him. His book, "The Shepherds' Prayer: A Christmas Novel," does just that.</p> <p> Author and publisher Richard Barry based his fictional tale on the real lives of a group of men we've all heard about but typically overlook -- the shepherds to whom the angel announced the birth of Jesus. Outside of our kid's school play, most of us have never given these important Biblical characters a second thought. Yet they were the first to hear the Good News. So what happened to them after that blessed first Christmas? Richard Barry's novel seeks to answer that thought-provoking question, and in a way that makes all of us appreciate the importance of Christ's Incarnation and how the seemingly insignificant birth of one baby in an obscure corner of the Roman Empire changed the world forever.</p> <p> In fact, Barry places the entire Christmas story into historical context in a way that few modern novels on the subject have done. He reminds us that there is a tragic component of the story, too -- the Slaughter of the Innocents. This was when the jealous King Herod ordered the murder of all the male babies in Bethlehem in an attempt to kill the Messiah, whom he saw as a rival. In "The Shepherds' Prayer," a young man who had been orphaned in this tragic massacre returns to Bethlehem thirty years later on a quest to discover his name and heritage. Having been raised in a culture where bloodlines mean everything, he seems forever condemned to live as an outsider on the fringes of society until he discovers his true identity. His only clue is a cryptic message on a lambskin blanket about a child born in a stable in Bethlehem. Who is this mysterious child? And what could such a child have to do with his own birth and destiny? Through a providential encounter with a small band of shepherds, the young man comes to realize that his quest has little to do with his genes -- and everything to do with his soul.</p> <p>This is a book that has the potential to become a Christmas classic because it is one of those rare novels that the entire family can enjoy. It focuses our attention on the life-changing power of faith during this special time of the year. Yes, decorating our Christmas trees and waiting for Santa to make his annual sleigh ride are fun traditions. But these things pale in comparison with the profound inspiration drawn from the remarkable story of the humble shepherds who first taught us what Christmas is really all about.</p> <p> The book is available as a hardcover book and as a three-CD audiobook. The audio version of the book is narrated by the "golden voice" of John McDonough, an accomplished actor, singer and narrator who has appeared on Broadway, in television and in movies.</p><b>The Story Behind <i>The Shepherds' Prayer</i></b> <p>It was the Christmas season of 1997 when I began thinking about the story that would eventually become <i>The Shepherds' Prayer</i>. My wife and I had just returned from church. We were talking about how wonderful the story of Christ's birth was and what it meant to the world then and now. </p><p>For all the good that came of His birth and for all that generations have read and talked about it since then, there also was great sadness that resulted in Bethlehem when Herod ordered the killing of all the male babies. Not much has been written or is ever said about that traumatic event and how it must have impacted the people of Bethlehem and their attitudes about the poor Galilean child who was the target of Herod's wrath. And not much has been written about the shepherds who were the first to proclaim that this child was the promised Messiah. How might their lives have been affected by Herod's massacre? I started thinking about those untold stories and, after researching them, found that they were inspiring stories that were begging to be told. And so I set out to try to tell them in a way that would lead the reader on his or her own journey to discover Christ and what it truly means to be a Christian. </p><p>We all need to be reminded in a deeper way why we celebrate this time of year. This Christmas season, I sincerely hope this story will help you to see the birth of Christ in a new and thought-provoking way. Consider reading it each year as a Christmas tradition in your home. </p><p>In Christ's Name,<br> Richard M.

Teens and reviewers alike have fallen in love with <em>Demonglass' </em>humor, forbidden romance, suspense, and delicious paranormal fun. <br>Sophie Mercer thought she was a witch, which was why she was sent to Hex Hall, a reform school for delinquent Prodigium (aka witches, shapeshifters, and fairies). But that was before she discovered she's a <i>demon</i>, and her hot crush, Archer Cross, is an agent for The Eye, a group bent on wiping her kind off the face of the earth. What's worse, Sophie has powers that threaten the lives of everyone she loves. Which is why she decides to go to London for the Removal, a risky procedure that will either destroy her powers forever-or kill her. But once Sophie arrives, she makes a shocking discovery: <i>someone</i> is raising new demons in secret and planning to use their powers to destroy the world. Meanwhile, The Eye is set on hunting Sophie down, and they're using Acher to do it. But it's not like she has feelings for him anymore. Does she?</p><p><strong>Rachel Hawkins</strong> (www.rachel-hawkins.com) is the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>Hex Hall</em> and <em>Spell</em> <em>Bound.</em> She was a high school English teacher before becoming a full-time writer.

Sophie is surrounded by handsome boys: her crush, demon-hunter Archer Cross, and the hunky but taciturn magical healer Cal. Although this second title lacks the plentiful humor of the first, narrator Sophies delivery is still delightfully brash, and the many action scenes lend a cinematic feel. An abrupt ending sets up readers for at least one more title.

Some were residents before recorded time; some lived in Iowa for relatively short periods but played memorable roles in the state&#x2019;s history; others visited Iowa mostly during hunting trips or times of war. Stimulating and informative, Lance Foster&#x2019;s <i>The Indians of Iowa</i> is the only book for the general reader that covers the archaeology, history, and culture of all the different native nations that have called Iowa home from prehistory to the present.<br> <br> Foster begins with a history of Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s travels along the Missouri River adjacent to western Iowa. Next, he focuses on the tribes most connected to Iowa from prehistoric times to the present day: the Ioway, Meskwaki, Sauk, Omaha and Ponca, Otoe and Missouria, Pawnee and Arikara, Potawatomi, Illinois Confederacy, Santee and Yankton Sioux, and Winnebago. In between each tribal account, &#x201c;closer look&#x201d; essays provide details on Indian women in Iowa, traditional ways of life, Indian history and spirituality, languages and place-names, archaeology, arts and crafts, and houses and landscapes. Finally, Foster brings readers into the present with chapters called &#x201c;Going to a Powwow,&#x201d; &#x201c;Do You Have Indian Blood?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Indians in Iowa Today.&#x201d; The book ends with information about visiting Native American museums, historic sites, and communities in Iowa as well as tribal contacts and a selection of published and online resources.<br> <br> The story of the Indians of Iowa is long and complicated. Illustrated with maps and stunning original art, Lance Foster&#x2019;s absorbing, accessible overview of Iowa&#x2019;s Indian tribes celebrates the rich native legacy of the Hawkeye State. It is essential reading for students, teachers, and everyone who calls Iowa home.</p></p><p>Lance Foster received a B.A. in anthropology and Native American studies from the University of Montana as well as an M.A. in anthropology and an M.L.A. in landscape architecture from Iowa State University; he is an alumnus of the Institute of American Indian Arts.

With refashioned language and reimagined motivations, Goldstein's biblical characters evoke the kind of touching truths only found at the bottom of deep barrel laughs. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This should not be at all surprising, as the fear of death and its aftermath has abided in the breasts of humans ever since they became cognizant of what it meant to no longer be alive in the manner in which it is traditionally understood. Animals, down to the most primitive invertebrates, share this fear without precisely being aware of what it means in a conscious sense, but they nonetheless do all they can to stay alive. The question of what follows the extinguishing of life probably does not keep mosquitoes or squirrels awake at night, but more than a few <i>homo sapiens</i> have pondered their uncertain futures with trepidation in the dark of night.<br> &nbsp;<br> All cultures on the planet have superstitions about the dead returning as spirits or -phantoms&#x2014;-belief systems memorialized in drawings and writings from the very beginnings of civilization. In the Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead,</i> departed people are shown to return, not merely looking as they did in life, but dressed in similar garments. Therefore, apparently not only do dead people have the ability to materialize, making themselves visible again after they are gone, but so do textiles, leather, and metal.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Bible, the story of King Saul calling on the Witch of Endor to summon the spirit of Samuel has been recorded, as have the questions surrounding whether Jesus after his resurrection was a living being or a ghost. From ancient texts in Greek mythology, various types of ghosts are described in Homer&#x2019;s <i>Iliad </i>and <i>Odyssey,</i> and Romans, notably Plutarch and Pliny the Younger, wrote about haunted houses.<br> &nbsp;<br> Literature of all eras abounds in ghosts stories. William Shakespeare often used ghosts in his plays, most famously in <i>Hamlet </i>and <i>Macbeth,</i> and Charles Dickens wrote the greatest pure ghost story of all time in <i>A Christmas Carol. </i>Others among the world&#x2019;s greatest authors who have written in the genre include Ben Jonson, Horace Walpole, Jane Austen, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Guy de Maupassant, Edgar Allan Poe, Wilkie Collins, Edward -Bulwer--Lytton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Oscar Wilde, Willa Cather, F. Scott -Fitzgerald&#x2014;-well, -really too many to continue.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is the great attraction of supernatural fiction in general, and the ghost story in particular? From the time of childhood, we have a fear of the dark (and rightly so, as we don&#x2019;t know exactly what is lurking out there, wrapped in the black cloak of invisibility). Although it frightens them, children still love to hear scary stories at bedtime; just consider such fairy tales as Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, and Little Red Riding Hood. We never outgrow our love of fairy tales, even if in adulthood they take a more complex form as stories about vampires, serial killers, werewolves, or terrorists.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ghost stories may be told in many different tones and styles, ranging from the excruciatingly horrific to the absurdly humorous. Ghosts, after all, may have widely divergent goals. Some return from the dead to wreak vengeance; others want to help a loved one. Some are the spirits of people who were murdered or committed suicide and so could not rest because their time officially had not yet come and therefore walked the earth instead of stretching out comfortably in their graves. Some were playful, enjoying the tricks and pranks their invisibility allowed them, while others delighted in their own cruelty, committing acts of violence and terror for the sheer inexplicable pleasure of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> All these ghosts, and more, appear in this volume. You will meet ghosts who frighten you, who make you laugh, and for whom you will feel sorry. And they are true ghosts. I have tried to remain true to the notion that ghosts are spirits or specters of the dead. Some stories that frequently have appeared in other ghost story anthologies have nothing at all to do with ghosts. They may be trolls, or evil plants, vile fungi, monsters, or other creatures of that ilk. Rightly or not, I have attempted to be a bit of a -narrow--minded purist about it all, not that it created a problem. There have been an astonishing number of outstanding ghost stories written by some of the finest authors who ever dared allow their dark creations to be set down on paper. It has been a confounding challenge to select the stories for this, the biggest collection of ghost stories ever compiled. It was tempting to include all the great classics but that would have filled to overflowing even this gigantic tome. It was equally tempting to stuff the pages with -little--known stories, often every bit the equal of the cornerstone titles, but it is impossible to attempt to produce the definitive collection of ghost stories and omit M. R. James, Algernon Blackwood, H. P. Lovecraft, or Edith Wharton. Although I admire some of the supernatural tales of Henry James, especially &#x201c;The Turn of the Screw,&#x201d; he won&#x2019;t be found here because that novella has been anthologized to death, is easy to find elsewhere, and is so long that a -half--dozen other stories would have had to be sacrificed. Putting together an anthology is not a pure science, so there are contradictions galore. I&#x2019;ve included &#x201c;The Monkey&#x2019;s Paw,&#x201d; for example, which has also been anthologized to the point of being a clich�. Still, it&#x2019;s short, -didn&#x2019;t use up too much space, and it is lively (unlike dear old Henry -James&#x2014;-no offense). To make up for the very familiar stories, I&#x2019;ve included some that you&#x2019;ve never seen before, several of which appear in book form for the very first time. The Golden Age of the ghost story (the late Victorian and Edwardian eras) is fully represented, and so is the Golden Age of the pulp magazines (the 1920s and 1930s), while the contemporary masters have not been ignored.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether this collection is best enjoyed next to a summer campfire or a winter fireplace is up to you. On the other hand, it is so enormous that it may endure through several seasons. Whenever you read it, I hope you have a shiveringly good time with it. After all, in the dead of night, who would not believe in ghosts?<br> &nbsp;<br> Although I read more than a thousand stories to find and identify those that I hope you will most enjoy, it would not have been possible to compile such a comprehensive and -wide--reaching volume without the invaluable assistance of those who know a great deal more than I do. Sincere, if hopelessly inadequate, thanks are owed to Robert Weinberg, John Pelan, Chris Roden, Gardner Dozois, Joel Frieman, Harlan Ellison, John Knott, and those I&#x2019;m forgetting who so freely and generously offered their assistance and expertise.</p><h2>Shadowblack (Spellslinger, 2)</h2><p><b>A failed mage turned outlaw must use guile and a handful of spells to challenge a dangerous rival in the second book of an exciting adventure fantasy series from Sebastien de Castell.</b><b><br></b>Forced to live as an outlaw, Kellen relies on his wits and his allies to survive the unforgiving borderlands. <br>When he meets a young woman cursed with a deadly plague, he feels compelled to help.

But a routine practice race turns disastrous in a collision of wood, metal, horses, and jockeys. Bonfire escapes unharmed, but is spooked and refuses to race. Alec Ramsey, the owner of the Black, witnesses the crash and is determined to see that Bonfire follow in the winning footsteps of his world-famous sire.</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.<p>Alec Ramsay was on the train that had left New York City's Pennsylvania Station at 7:05 p.m. and would arrive at Roosevelt Raceway, Westbury, Long Island, by&nbsp;eight o'clock. This would be a half-hour before the first race of the evening, giving him time to locate Bonfire, the second son of the Black Stallion.<br> He wondered about this three-year-old colt, whom he had never seen. Had the Black stamped Bonfire as his own in body, head and temperament? Or had that small, quiet harness-racing mare been the more dominant in marking her son? Soon he'd know, and he looked forward eagerly to meeting Bonfire and watching him race beneath the lights in a sport Alec had known&nbsp;previously only at county and state fairs.<br> He turned away from the window, where the suburban apartment buildings were giving way to more and more areas of spacious green. He was thankful he wore only a light sport shirt, for the July day had been extremely hot and the coming night promised little relief.<br> The car was crowded, with every seat taken and men standing in the aisles. The stranger sitting beside him was absorbed in reading a long typewritten statement, but suddenly he looked up, caught Alec's&nbsp;eyes, and said, "Sometimes I think a trainer does a better job of training the owner than he does the horse."<br> Alec glanced at the paper, this time noting the letterhead which read, "fred ringo's stable." Quietly he said, "That all depends on the trainer and the owner."<br> "Take this item," the stranger went on. "Leg lotion, two dollars and fifty cents. My wife claims my colt uses more lotion than she does. And I can't even tell her what it's for."<br> Alec smiled. "Leg lotion is a mild liniment they put on a horse's legs before doing him up," he said.<br> The man looked at Alec. "You mean you know something about horses?"<br> "A little."<br> "Then maybe you can explain a few of these other items I'm paying for. My wife says it's time I found out. But it's hard to pin Freddy Ringo down, especially on race night. What's this foot grease?" He grinned. "Make him go faster?"<br> "Not directly," Alec answered. "Although anything you do to keep a horse's feet in good condition is bound&nbsp;to help his speed. Foot grease is put on hoofs to keep them soft and to prevent cracks."<br> "How about this clay for packing feet?" the man asked, turning to his statement again.<br> "Pounding a hard racetrack day after day often results in a horse's feet becoming hot and wet. The clay is used overnight to help draw out the heat."<br> "You seem to know more than just a little about this game," the man said. "Do you own a harness racer too?"<br> "No."<br> The man put out his right hand. "My name is Dick Frecon," he said.&nbsp;"I own the three-year-old colt Lively Man. Guess you've seen him out here."<br> Alec shook the man's hand. "No, I haven't been here before. My name is Ramsay . . . Alec Ramsay."<br> Frecon's heavy eyebrows bunched quickly. "What did you say your name was?" he asked. His gaze had left Alec's face, wandering to the boy's large hands, then to the broad shoulders.<br> "Ramsay," Alec repeated.<br> Frecon was studying his face. "Not the jockey," he said. "Not the one&nbsp;who was up on the Black and Satan . . . and last year, Black Minx. Not that Alec Ramsay."<br> "They're our horses," Alec admitted.<br> "Well, what do you know!" Frecon said incredulously. "For years I've been following you and never getting closer than the nearest grandstand." He folded his statement and put it away. "And now that I've switched sports I find myself sitting next to you, even asking if you know horses!" Patting his pocket, he said, "Sorry about all those questions."<br> "You needn't be," Alec said. "If anyone has a horse in training he should know what he's paying for."<br> "That's what my wife says." For a moment they rode in silence, then Frecon said, "Do you mind my asking what you're doing out here?"<br> "There's a colt I want to see," Alec said. "He's going in the second race."<br> "Why, that's my colt's race too!" Frecon said, sitting up straighter in his seat. "What do you have in it?"<br> "I don't have anything in it," Alec said, smiling. "But the colt's name is Bonfire. He's sired by the Black."<br> "Oh, sure, I should have thought of that since the boys were talking about him last week. Seems he was a whirlwind last year at two, but he hasn't done much this season. He's owned by a Jimmy Creech of Coronet, Pennsylvania."<br> "That's right," Alec said. "Mr. Creech&nbsp;is an old friend of my partner, Henry Dailey. That's how his harness mare happened to be bred to the Black."<br> "I'd sure like to meet Henry Dailey," Frecon said, "--and the Black and Satan."<br> "Then why don't you come up to the farm sometime? We're only a two-hour ride from New York."<br> "I sure will. I'd love to, if you're sure it's all right."<br> "Of course it's all right," Alec said.<br> The train was slowing, coming into the station at Westbury.<br> "I can't wish this Bonfire much luck tonight," Frecon said, "not with my colt in the same race. Who's driving him anyway? One of the big trainers?"<br> "No, he's being trained and driven by a young fellow named Tom Messenger. I don't know anything about him except that he comes from Coronet and is a friend of Mr. Creech, who's sick at home and can't be here."<br> "Then you know this Jimmy Creech?"<br> "No, I don't know him, either." Alec smiled. "I don't know anyone," he added, ". . . not even Bonfire. I'm just looking forward to meeting them."<br> "Well," Frecon said, standing&nbsp;up as the train stopped, "I can't say I mind hearing about this Tom Messenger driving Bonfire. I wouldn't like to see a son of the Black in the hands of any of the top men out here. Not with my colt in the same race and with hay at seventy dollars a ton!"<br> Later Alec moved with the crowd streaming through the main entrance gate of Roosevelt Raceway. It was not yet dark but the track lights were already on. Dance music came over the public-address system.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Said the Shotgun to the Head</h2><p>The greatest Americans<br> Have not been born yet <br> They are waiting quietly<br> For their past to die <br> <b>please give blood</b> <br> Here is the account of a man so ravished by a kiss that it distorts his highest and lowest frequencies of understanding into an Incongruent mean of babble and brilliance...</p><p>Saul Williams is an acclaimed poet, musician, and actor.

Following The Seventh Octave (1998) and S/he (1999), Williams's third print collection (this time with no CD), is described as an "epic," and begins with a chilling epigraph from Paul Robeson on the warped combine of Western values, creativity, star power and suicide. It prefigures the set of toxic contradictions Williams attempts to negotiate, moving quickly into big-fonted oracular mode, channeling "those ships that never sailed/ the ones with their seacocks open/ that lied scuttled in their stalls/ TODAY/ i bring them back/ HUGE AND INTRANSITORY"-simultaneously invoking thwarted ambition, sexual exposure, the Middle Passage, and attempts to "lie" (dissimulate as well as collapse) through it all. Throughout the book, Williams draws on messianic postures and pronouncements that are non-starters, dragging out the most shopworn heresies and tropes: "we will wait through the degenerate course/ of your repeated history/ we will wait for the past to die." Yet such moments are repeatedly undercut by brief, understated bouts of lyrical intimacy and self-scrutiny: "i cannot make/ your past disappear/ only rabbits, my love/ only rabbits." It is through their juxtaposition that readers glimpse the pathos of a poet struggling with a literally unspeakable historical past, and deeply unworkable present-as well as levity in the futility of trying to dispel it all with corporate-backed, art-based bunnies. (A mock interview between a "Journalist" and "Maned Character" delves into the contradictions of being published by MTV.) The end result is an oblique attempt at moving past flawed concepts of gender, violence, race, religion and exchange, proceeding by sheer will and sometimes a "turn the music up" determination. Despite an absurdly overblown conclusion, it works-almost despite itself. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fisherman and His Wife</h2><p>Caldecott Honor?winning artist Rachel Isadora brings another fabulous fairy tale to brilliant life with her stunning collages.

In it, one is brought face-to-face with Judaism&#39;s central struggle for an understanding of God, human life, and the world. Mastery of the Siddur enables one to worship as a Jew and to grasp the essence of Judaism. Now, in this engaging and highly informative book, Rabbi Hammer provides an introduction to the liturgy of the Siddur. More than a &#34;how-to&#34; guide, Entering Jewish Prayer deals with the basic issues in prayer for the modern worshipper; the historical compilation of the Siddur; the orchestration of the daily, Sabbath, and festival prayers; the themes of special prayers, such as the Blessing After Meals and the Kaddish; and the essential experience of making prayer a vital part of one&#39;s life. For anyone who has ever felt lost or confused at a Jewish service, or anyone interested in an introduction to this facet of Jewish literacy, Entering Jewish Prayer provides a key to meaningful participation and spiritual growth.<b>REUVEN HAMMER</b>&nbsp;earned his rabbinical ordination and a doctorate in theology at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.

Raoul Plus&#39;s no-nonsense prayer manual dispels the false notions of prayer that we all have and shows how we can, in fact, pray without ceasing even at times when exhaustion cripples us and cares threaten to sweep us away.</p><p>Christ urges us to pray without ceasing, but when we try to do so, many of us simply cease without praying. We're distracted by troubles or duty or we quit just because it's late already and we're tired. <p> Fr. Raoul Plus's no-nonsense prayer manual, How to Pray Always, remedies these problems by dispelling the false notions of prayer we all have and showing how we can, in fact, pray without ceasing even at times when exhaustion cripples us and cares threaten to sweep us away. </p><p> Drawing on the experience of dozens of saints, Fr. Plus explains sure ways we can recollect ourselves before prayer so that once we begin to pray, our prayers will be richer and more productive; he teaches us how to practice interior silence habitually, even in the rush and noise of the world; and he explains each of the kinds of prayer and shows when we should and should not employ each. </p><p> As humans, our minds are limited and it's generally hard for us to pay attention to more than a few things at once. That's why most of us aren't able to think of God or pray while we fulfill any but the most mindless of our daily duties. </p><p> No problem. </p><p> For such busy occasions (which constitute most of the time for most of us), Fr. Plus explains how we can pray without words by keeping our wills united to God even when our minds must be directed elsewhere. </p><p> In other words, How to Pray Always is one of those rare books that actually fulfills the promise of its title. It helps us become better Christians by showing us how to know, to love, and to serve God, and to live prayerfully and constantly in His loving presence.</p>Raoul Plus, S.J. (1882&#x2013;1958) wrote more than forty books to help Christians understand God's love for the soul. His works stress the vital role of prayer in the spiritual life and show how you can live the truths of the faith.</p><h2>A History of the Church in 100 Objects</h2><p><b>Winner of two Catholic Press Association Awards: Design and Production (Second Place) and History (Honorable Mention).<br> The star of Bethlehem exemplifies the birth of Jesus, the Wittenberg Door is synonymous with the Protestant Reformation, and &#x201c;the pill&#x201d; symbolizes the sexual revolution.

It delves into the creation and evolution of the world and the reigns of the gods on earth, before introducing us to the manifestations of Egypt&#x2019;s deities in the natural environment; the inventive ways in which the Egyptians dealt with the invisible forces all around them; and their beliefs about life after death.<br><p>Through his engaging narrative, Garry Shaw guides us through the mythic adventures of such famous deities as Osiris, the god murdered by his jealous brother Seth; the magical and sometimes devious Isis, who plotted to gain the power of the sun god Re; and Horus, who defeated his uncle Seth to become king of Egypt. He also introduces us to lesser known myths, such as the rebellions against Re; Geb&#x2019;s quest for Re&#x2019;s magical wig; and the flaying of the unfortunate god Nemty. From stars and heavenly bodies sailing on boats, to the wind as manifestation of the god Shu, to gods, goddesses, ghosts, and demons&#x2015;beings that could be aggressive, helpful, wise, or dangerous&#x2015;Shaw goes on to explain how the Egyptians encountered the mythological in their everyday lives.</p> 100+ illustrations</p><p>Garry J.

He argues that most performance and achievement problems are rooted in knowledge gaps, motivation gaps, and institutional gaps, or a combination thereof. This book provides an overview of each of these 3 dimensions, and discusses ways that they can affect performance. It discusses a problem-solving framework that helps pinpoint where gaps exist in school efforts to improve performance, and then targets the development of solutions and successful outcome loops that are customized to the specific areas that are problematic. The book concludes with a discussion of cultural and contextual considerations that must be taken into account when addressing school-based problems. </p><p>At a time of shrinking budgets and growing accountability, this practical book provides a way to assure that scarce resources are targeted appropriately.</p></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;Rueda offers important insights and constructive suggestions that will benefit leaders, policymakers, and teachers at all levels."<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Douglas B.

A horizontal electric field producing vertical polarization in dielectrics; an unbalanced car wheel wobbling in the vertical plane while spinning about a horizontal axis; an electrostatic field on Earth observed to be a magnetic field by orbiting astronauts&#x2015;these are some situations where physicists employ tensors. But the true beauty of tensors lies in this fact: When coordinates are transformed from one system to another, tensors change according to the same rules as the coordinates. Tensors, therefore, allow for the convenience of coordinates while also transcending them. This makes tensors the gold standard for expressing physical relationships in physics and geometry. </p><p>Undergraduate physics majors are typically introduced to tensors in special-case applications. For example, in a classical mechanics course, they meet the "inertia tensor," and in electricity and magnetism, they encounter the "polarization tensor." However, this piecemeal approach can set students up for misconceptions when they have to learn about tensors in more advanced physics and mathematics studies (e.g., while enrolled in a graduate-level general relativity course or when studying non-Euclidean geometries in a higher mathematics class). </p><p>Dwight E. Neuenschwander's <i>Tensor Calculus for Physics</i> is a bottom-up approach that emphasizes motivations before providing definitions. Using a clear, step-by-step approach, the book strives to embed the logic of tensors in contexts that demonstrate why that logic is worth pursuing. It is an ideal companion for courses such as mathematical methods of physics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and relativity.</p></p><p><p>Using a clear, step-by-step approach, this book explains one of the more difficult&#x2015;yet crucial&#x2015;topics in physics.</p><p><b>Dwight E.

Christine is a single mother who is trying to keep it together at a time when events seem to conspire against her. Just when everything looks darkest, a simple act of kindness creates a shower of good deeds that spread Christmas in surprising ways. Donna VanLiere is more qualified than most authors to narrate her own book--by virtue of her background in theater and radio--and she doesn&#39;t disappoint here. VanLiere gives just enough distinction to the various characters to communicate the shifts from the first-person point of view of Christine&#39;s story to the varying points of view of the subplots and their colorful characters. VanLiere&#39;s British accent even gets an outing through an expat Brit who frequents Betty&#39;s Bakery. This lovely Christmas story, like a well-made pastry, is good at any time of year.

His name is Rajiv George and he is short and portly and has kind eyes. He laughs often. Great, he says. In a restaurant that's really all you need. We'll teach you everything else.<br><br>Does that mean I'm hired? I ask. The Olive Garden is the fourth restaurant to interview me. I filled out applications at thirteen.<br><br>I think so, he laughs. Congratulations. Are you sure you don't want a breadstick? He gestures at the basket of fluffy wands between us on the table. They glisten with garlic butter.<br><br>No thank you, I say. I ate earlier.<br><br>Well, you could use some meat on your bones. He twinkles so I try to twinkle back. Employees can have as much bread and soda as they want, he says.<br><br>Okay, I say. When do I start?<br><br>Now? he asks. It's only three thirty. You can learn how to make salads and help out tonight. The salad girl called in sick. Word to the wise, if you're gonna call in, do it as early as possible. Actually--the wise don't call in. Find someone to cover the shift. Right, Kendall? He says this to a tall, stunning man who walks past the booth, then pauses to tie on a black apron with three pockets across the front. His white shirt is unbuttoned and I see a leather necklace with a pewter cross that hangs so it just touches the beginning of his chest fur, visible over the top edge of a wife-beater. His sleeves are rolled up and he has snakes tattooed around both forearms.<br><br>Right, boss, he says. Who's this?<br><br>He is facing Mr. George, but means me. He pops up his collar and buttons the top button, then takes a blue tie out of one of his apron pockets and ties it with quick aggressive movements. There is a grease spot he is careful to hide within the knot.<br><br>This is Marie, says Mr. George. She's new.<br><br>No shit, says Kendall. How old is she? Twelve?<br><br>Excuse him, says Mr. George. He was in Desert Storm.<br><br>I was in fourth grade during Desert Storm but I don't say this. I won a lot of mental math competitions that year including the regional title and I didn't pay attention to the news. But we had to write letters to the soldiers, and the math team coach made us tie yellow ribbons on our competition pencils. Kendall extends his right hand to me while rolling down the sleeve with his left.<br><br>Christopher Kendall, he says. Marie, I say, shaking his hand. It is warm and dry and strong. He has a silver Celtic knot ring on his thumb.<br><br>You ain't got a last name, Cabbage Patch?<br><br>Cut it out, Mr. George says to Christopher. I just hired her, don't run her off yet. At least not before she fills in for the salad girl tonight.<br><br>Young, I say to Christopher. Yes you are, he says. Did you give her the tour? he asks Mr. George.<br><br>No, says Mr. George. Are you volunteering? Don't think it gets you out of opening sidework.<br><br>Why do you think I want a little helper? says Christopher, and to me, Come on, doll, I'll show you around.<br><br>Don't forget what we talked about last night, says Mr. George as we walk away from the booth toward the swing door that leads into the kitchen.<br><br>Fuck your mother, Apu, Christopher says under his breath. Raj is harmless, he says to me. But don't eat the bread or you'll wind up like him and that would be tragic. He gives me a blatant up-and-down as he says tragic.<br><br>This is the back station, he says. We are standing in front of a soda machine and a computer screen. He continues, By the bar is the front station. Over in the twenties is the side station. Back station is safest. Ring at the bar and somebody's gonna ask you for change, or when the dingbat hostess leaves the door you'll end up seating. Side station is right between two big-tops so somebody is bound to need something, and there's always a fucking kid throwing crayons on the floor. Parents think you're a prick if you don't stop everything and pick em up for Johnny. Nobody can see you here.<br><br>Okay, I say. He takes a clear plastic cup from a stack by the soda machine and plunges it into the ice. Plastic for us, glass for them, he says. Always use the ice scoop. Georgie sees you doing this you'll get yelled at. It's unsanitary. Plus if you break a glass in the ice we have to burn it. Where is the ice scoop? I ask. Fuck if I know, he says. He fills his cup with Mountain Dew and takes a straw wrapped in paper from a cardboard box on the stainless-steel shelf above the soda machine. He tears the paper about an inch from the top of the straw, throwing away the long part and leaving the short part on like a cap. He stabs the straw into the cup. This is how you serve a soda, he says. Make sure it's full. Fuckers drink it like it's fucking crack. Put a straw in it. Leave the top on the straw so they know you didn't put your nasty paws all over where their mouth goes. Always have extra straws in your apron because some lazy asshole in the section next to you won't give his people straws, and when you walk by they'll ask you for one, and if you don't have one you gotta find dipshit or get it yourself. He takes the paper cap off the straw and flicks it into the trash. The fizzing head on the soda has settled so he tops it off and then takes a big suck. I recommend a straw for your personal consumption as well, he says. Never put your mouth on anything in a restaurant if you can help it. Shit doesn't get clean. Ever.<br><br>Okay, I say. Yo, is that all you say? he asks.<br><br>No, I say, but I'm here to work. He raises his eyebrows at this and says, Oh! He looks around. She's here to work, he says to another server who walks by with a gray plastic tub of silverware. Great, says the other server, I need help with these rollups.<br><br>Sorry, Dave, I called her first, says Christopher. This way, honey.<br><br>He takes my elbow and guides me toward the kitchen. Dave's a faggot, but he's a good guy, he says. I heard that, says Dave.<br><br>Outside the kitchen door hangs a broom and dustpan. There's the broom, says Christopher. Somebody breaks a glass use it. Don't pick it up with your hands. Tell one of the busboys you're busy and make them do it.<br><br>He kicks open the kitchen door and points up at a circular mirror hanging from the ceiling. Coming out, check that or you'll knock somebody down and then people will think you're stupid. Going in, look through the window. First time you bump a tray out of somebody's hands is not gonna be pleasant for you, or them, and if it's me you're doing all my sidework for a week. Trays, tray jacks, he says, gesturing toward a stack of big brown ovals and wooden stands with black nylon straps. You can carry a tray, right?<br><br>I don't know, I say. He gives me his full attention for the first time. Wait, he says. You ever worked in a restaurant before?<br><br>No, I say. I fucking knew it, he says, I could tell the second I saw you. He shakes his head slowly, looking around the kitchen. A skinny boy in a white coat is chopping onions. He looks up at us. A tear slides down his nose and he raises his shoulder to rub it off. Don't cry, Jose, don't cry, says Christopher. Jose says I'm sorry, Chris, it's just so sad how ugly your mom is, but Christopher doesn't answer because another server comes into the kitchen through the door at the opposite end. Sup Chris, says the new server, then Sup Kelly, Tare-Bear to two women who are standing in a corner talking while they do their makeup. Hey Josh, says Christopher, guess what we got here. Josh is punching in on the time clock by the office. Mr. George sticks his head out and says Don't punch in unless you're working. I'm working, I'm working, says Josh. What do we got, Chris?<br><br>A fucking virgin, everybody. Chris grabs my hand and yanks it up into the air like I won a boxing match. This is Marie, and today's her first day in a restaurant. Welcome to hell, baby. He laughs a sadistic laugh. He has beautiful beautiful teeth. I pull my hand down and look toward the office but Mr. George is on the phone, his back to us.<br><br>Don't look at him, says Christopher. You gotta make it with us. He don't know shit about how to wait tables.<br><br>I nod. I know, I say, I was just looking at the clock.<br><br>Uh-huh, says Christopher. There's only two times in a restaurant: before and after. You walk in, you white-knuckle it, try not to fuck up till it's over and then it's over. You made money or you didn't.<br><br>God, leave her alone, Chris, says one of the women. Ignore him, she says to me. He's so full of himself it's disgusting.<br><br>Christopher walks toward her so I follow him. What's disgusting, Tara, he says softly, is how full of me you'd like to be. Fuck off, says Kelly. Tara yells toward the office, Raj, Chris is harassing me again! but then both women start giggling. Don't worry, sweetie, Kelly says. He's all talk. That's not what she said last night, says Christopher. Kelly rolls her eyes. Fine, you win, she says. I would rather fuck myself with an OG bread stick but you can pretend if you want.<br><br>Don't believe anything he says, she tells me as she pushes open the kitchen door with her back, pulling her hair up into a ponytail.<br><br>How old are you, anyway, asks Christopher, leading us into a humid room off the kitchen where a man in a plastic apron says Hola. He is using a big nozzle on a spring to spray some large metal pans in a deep sink. This is the dish pit, yells Christopher over the noise of the water and the clanking of the pans. And watch out, they haven't put down the mats yet. You got good shoes? He leans over and pinches my pant leg away from my knee, lifting the hem so he can see my black canvas sneakers. He has three fingers behind my knee, and when he closes his hand his thumb is so high up on my inseam I look at him to see what it means. He looks at me back and squeezes as he says Those won't work. You need some nonslip soles or you'll wind up on your ass wearing cannelloni. Payless in the mall has some cheap ones.<br><br>I'll be eighteen in two weeks, I say, adding a year. He whistles. He puts an arm around my shoulder and yells at the dishwasher, pointing at me with his other hand, Hey Jose, es una bambina!<br><br>Stop, I say. What? he says. I just said you're a babe. I know what you said, I say. Ella hablas espanol tambien, he yells at Jose. No me llamo Jose, says the dishwasher. He sticks out a wet red hand. Mario, he says. Marie, I say, shaking his hand. Ah, Maria! he says. Somos gemelos! I smile. Mucho gusto, I say. Come on, says Christopher, enough fucking around. Let's get to work.<br>The third man I'd ever had sex with was an ex-corrections officer who is six-four and the most gorgeous man I've ever seen or ever will. It may seem rash to hand out that superlative to someone I met as a teenager, but perfection cannot be perfected. His teeth were perfectly square, even, and white, his smile dazzling beneath thick blue-black hair, his eyes a brilliant unseen color of bottle green backlit with navy, his olive skin so smooth and taut it made you feel that if you closed your eyes you might be his, you might be somewhere else. In the restaurant where we worked, he would take four crates of clean glasses from the dish machine, stack them, and balance them above his shoulder with one arm to bring them into the kitchen. I could barely lift two to chest level using my whole body. But there was no bulk, he was just on the solid side of lean. The strength in him was panther-dark and menacing and in spite of the ordinary green lines across the toes of his dress socks I was too scared of him to get wet. He fucked me anyway, with a giant penis I couldn't bring myself to look at. I was like a child, I was quiet and tense and bit my tongue and lip to keep silent when he pulled out and ground himself to a sterile stop on me. Pushing through every layer of sensitive tissue and fat to pin me to the bed, he succeeded in giving himself an orgasm, avoiding ejaculation, controlling his breathing, and keeping his face composed. He made no sound and took no notice of me--I knew of his completion only through the ripples against my mons. Later when I put my hand on his on the gearshift on the way back to the restaurant he said from behind his aviators Do you know what the words No one mean. Three weeks later he was fired in the middle of a shift for harassing the underage salad girl and I had to take over his tables.<br><br>I think he could tell I was pregnant the day we did it. I don't think he cared. I begged him to fuck me. I followed him around the restaurant, touching him. I stood next to him when we sang Buona Festa. I didn't even know how to fuck. It was four months then but I still didn't show through my clothes at five, or six and a half. At seven I had to move the apron down to my hips. I worked there until she was born.<br><br>We went back to the restaurant together that day because we were both between doubles. I know that's what we did but I forget that. It seems like I stayed on the bed and he left. I see myself naked. I hadn't touched my belly yet. I never looked at it. Christopher didn't answer my phone calls. I started calling him that night after work but he never answered. I called him all the time. I knew he wouldn't answer but then I would be calling him without even knowing why or what I would say. In the restaurant he'd say Hey if I said Hey Christopher but he never said my name and he ignored me. I see myself on the bed naked calling him. Christopher. Christopher. If he would just answer I would touch my belly.</p><h2>The Confessions of Frannie Langton: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;A startling, compelling historical debut novel. . . should be on top of your vacation reading pile.&#x201d; -The <em>Washington Post</em></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;A stunning debut. . . .

In any case, the man who loses his head in <i>The Man Who Lost His Head</i> isn&#x2019;t about to grin (that is, if he could grin) and bear it. No, he&#x2019;ll make himself a new one, and starting with a pumpkin and moving on to a parsnip and finally picking up a block of wood, he sets about getting it just right. Still, for all his efforts, it somehow isn&#x2019;t right. It isn&#x2019;t the head he had before. It turns out that only a brash bold boy can save the man who lost his head from losing it altogether.<br><br>Claire Huchet Bishop&#x2019;s charming parable is illustrated by the great Robert McCloskey, whose books for children include <i>One Morning in Maine</i>, <i>Blueberries for Sa</i>l, and the Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winning <i>Make Way for Ducklings</i>.</p><p><b>Claire Huchet Bishop (ca. 1899&#x2013;1993) </b>was a librarian, storyteller, critic, and writer. She grew up in Le Havre, France, and attended the Sorbonne for a time before founding France&#x2019;s first library for children, L&#x2019;Heure Joyeuse. Her children&#x2019;s books grew out of the popular stories she told both at L&#x2019;Heure Joyeuse and at the New York Public Library, where she worked after marrying the pianist Frank Bishop and settling in the United States. Among the seventeen works of fiction she wrote for children are <i>The Five Chinese Brothers </i>(1938), <i>Twenty and Ten</i> (1952), and the Newbery Honor books <i>Pancakes-Paris</i> (1947) and <i>All Alone </i>(1953). Bishop also wrote several biographies for children and nonfiction works for adults, and served as children&#x2019;s book editor at <i>Commonweal</i> during the 1930s. Active during the Second World War in the cause of European Jews, she devoted herself after the war to fostering better understanding between Jews and Christians, writing <i>How Catholics Look at Jews</i> (1974) and encouraging the Vatican&#x2019;s recognition of the State of Israel. <br><br><b>Robert McCloskey (1914&#x2013;2003) </b>was born in Ohio and moved east to study art in Boston and New York. He was awarded a prestigious Rome Prize, but World War II made it impossible for him to go to Rome. Renowned as a draftsman, McCloskey provided illustrations for a variety of authors and also wrote and illustrated eight books of his own, including <i>Blueberries for Sal</i> (1948), <i>One Morning in Maine</i> (1952), and the Caldecott Award&#x2013;winning stories <i>Make Way for Ducklings</i> (1941) and <i>Time of Wonde</i>r (1958). McCloskey&#x2019;s last book, <i>Burt Dow: Deep-Water Man</i>, came out in 1963. In 2003, he died on the Maine island where he had lived with his family since the 1940s.<p>"It&#x2019;s always a pleasure when a book is rereleased, but it&#x2019;s a particular pleasure when that same book has such an illustrious pedigree.&nbsp; The Bishop/McCloskey pairing didn&#x2019;t happen very often, but we can sure be glad that it did with this hidden treasure.&#x201d; &#x2014;Elizabeth Bird,&nbsp;<i>School Library Journal</i><br><br>"Awakening sans his head, the man at the center of the tale tries to remember where he left it....The solution is as madcap as the rest of the story...but the prose and Caldecott winner McCloskey's deliciously crisp artwork are evergreen." &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>--Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"[Bishop] has contrived out of what seems to be an impossible situation an entirely diverting farce, beautifully turned in phrase with the kind of zany logic essential to good nonsense...Strongly drawn pictures cap the tale with comedy in good country style." --<i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>Fascinating Fungi of the North Woods</h2><p>Learn about fascinating fungi of the North Woods in the first guide exclusively for Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

Readily accessible to general readers as well as high school students, teachers, and undergraduates, it includes much information unavailable elsewhere.<br>This single-volume edition comprises both <i>The Classical Theories </i>and<i> The Modern Theories,</i> which were originally published separately. The first volume covers the theories of classical physics from the age of the Greek philosophers to the late 19th century. The second volume chronicles discoveries that led to the advances of modern physics, focusing on special relativity, quantum theories, general relativity, matrix mechanics, and wave mechanics. Noted historian of science I. Bernard Cohen, who reviewed these books for <i>Scientific American,</i> observed, "I know of no other history of electricity which is as sound as Whittaker's.

Case studies from around the country clearly show how to implement best practices, as well as provide guidance for customizing design applications to a city&#x2019;s unique needs.&nbsp; <i>Urban Street Design Guide</i> outlines five goals and tenets of world-class street design:<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Streets are public spaces</i>. Streets play a much larger role in the public life of cities and communities than just thoroughfares for traffic. <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Great streets are great for business</i>. Well-designed streets generate higher revenues for businesses and higher values for homeowners.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Design for safety</i>. Traffic engineers can and should design streets where people walking, parking, shopping, bicycling, working, and driving can cross paths safely.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Streets can be changed</i>. Transportation engineers can work flexibly within the building envelope of a street. Many city streets were created in a different era and need to be reconfigured to meet new needs.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Act now!</i> Implement projects quickly using temporary materials to help inform public decision making.<br><br>Elaborating on these fundamental principles, the guide offers substantive direction for cities seeking to improve street design to create more inclusive, multi-modal urban environments.&nbsp; It is an exceptional resource for redesigning streets to serve the needs of 21st century cities, whose residents and visitors demand a variety of transportation options, safer streets, and vibrant community life.<br><br></p><p>The National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) is a membership network that provides support and resources for city transportation officials in cities of all sizes.

She writes novels, short stories and non-fiction and has been published in places such as The Guardian, Interzone, McSweeney's Internet Tendency, Black Static, Strange Horizons, and anthologies such as Fox Spirit's European Monsters and Lonely Planet's Better than Fiction I and II. She has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize twice, and won the Drabblecast People's Choice Award in 2007. Her novella, The Beauty, was shortlisted for a Shirley Jackson Award and a Sabotage Award, and appeared on the Honors List for the James Tiptree Jr Award."Teeming with the spirit of feminist speculative trailblazers like Margaret Atwood, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Joanna Russ, Whiteley's original, gut-wrenching tale renders a world that exists somewhere between post-apocalyptic and fable-esque. Her characters are as multidimensional, nuanced, and somber as her writing, which soaks the reader like a hot bath, and the novel's clever premise surprises as it evolves in an unforgettably grotesque yet thematically justified fashion, despite at times feeling slightly didactic.&nbsp;In short, Whiteley lives up to her various accolades (Guardian Short Story Award finalist, Shirley Jackson award nominee, etc.) with her sixth book-length effort, which&nbsp;channels the eerie spirit of Kelly Link and the environmental surrealism of Jeff VanderMeer. A murky delirium of sinuous language and unnerving storytelling that will delight both experienced genre fanatics and literary fiction lovers alike." - Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Elegantly written, balancing on the line that divides prose from poetry." &nbsp;-Booklist <br><br>"It&#x2019;s completely different story-wise, but for those who like the Walking Dead, I think they will especially enjoy this apocalyptic tale and the stress of surviving as a group. The Beauty is well worth a read. It&#x2019;s engaging, makes you think, and is treading new ground." Scream Magazine<br><br> This novella should win stuff. Seriously, just read it. Original work is being done. Here's proof. **** -- Nina Allan <br><br>I was provoked, shocked, disgusted, touched and, ultimately, I emerged feeling wiser. A brilliant, haunting original. **** -- Craig Lines Den Of Geek <br><br>This is a short book with a lot to say, all of it interesting ... Most of all it's about the power of storytelling to preserve our past and shape our future, and so one can see why it would appeal to an imprint called Unsung Stories, on this evidence a name to look out for. The Beauty is intellectual and visceral, frightening and thoughtful, an adventure and a meditation. **** -- Stephen Theaker <br><br>Interzone If I were to push one book on you from 2014, shove one book at you and say "this", it would be The Beauty. **** -- Benjamin Judge <br><br>Aliya Whiteley's elegant, dreamlike prose masterfully frames the most slippery of issues - the fluidity of gender and sexuality; history and the power of propaganda; the value of life in all its forms, and the complex, grotesque nature of desire and disgust.

Deputy State Police Chief Kevin Kerney suspects the slaying wasn&#x2019;t random at all&#x2014;but rather a calculated plot to eliminate one high-profile victim, retired judge, Vernon Langsford. In piecing together the judge&#x2019;s shocking past, Kerney discovers the victim&#x2019;s predilection for sexual indiscretions, a history of family betrayal and greed, and a dark marriage that ended mysteriously and violently. But as Kerney gets closer to the heart of a terrible crime, it&#x2019;s a woman from his own past who emerges with a stunning secret of her own.</p><p>A new Kevin Kerney mystery is a bright spot in any publishing season, and in McGarrity's fifth book in the series, he brings Kerney back home to southern New Mexico on the trail of a spree killer who's murdered six victims at remote campgrounds. But something in the crime pattern tells Kerney these murders aren't as random as they first appear. Instead, they seem to be senseless killings meant to cover up the last one, a very personal crime involving family secrets hidden for generations. It's supposed to be the last case for Kerney, whose unexpected inheritance of a vast tract of prime ranchland and recent marriage to a career army officer (<i>Hermit's Peak</i>, <i>Serpent Gate</i>) have him putting in for early retirement from the police force. And it's all mixed up with a stalker seeking revenge on Kerney for his part in an Internal Affairs investigation that got a cop kicked off the force and led to a deadly gunfight that still haunts Kerney. <p> This is a solid bull's-eye for McGarrity. It leaves the reader hungry for his next, in which presumably Kerney will rethink his retirement plans as he copes with impending fatherhood and the kind of financial freedom most lawmen never experience. What makes this series work is not only its likable hero but also the brilliant evocation of the American Southwest he calls home. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Michael McGarrity is author of the Anthony Award-nominated <b>Tularosa</b>, <b>Mexican Hat</b>, <b>Serpent Gate</b>, <b>Hermit's Peak</b>, <b>The Judas Judge</b>, <b>Under the Color of Law</b>, and <b>The Big Gamble</b>.

She plans only to check on her ailing mother and leave. But Tilly decides to stay, and though she is still an outcast, her lush, exquisite dresses prove irresistible to the prim women of Dungatar. Through her fashion business, her friendship with Sergeant Farrat&#x2014;the town&#x2019;s only policeman, who harbors an unusual passion for fabrics&#x2014;and a budding romance with Teddy, the local football star whose family is almost as reviled as hers, she finds a measure of grudging acceptance. But as her dresses begin to arouse competition and envy in town, causing old resentments to surface, it becomes clear that Tilly&#x2019;s mind is set on a darker design: exacting revenge on those who wronged her, in the most spectacular fashion.</p><p><b>Rosalie Ham</b> is the author of three novels.

Recently she had written to her mother but when she received no reply, she summoned the courage to phone. The curt voice at the telephone exchange had said, &#x2018;Molly Dunnage hasn&#x2019;t had a phone on for years, she wouldn&#x2019;t know what a phone was.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I wrote,&#x2019; said Tilly. &#x2018;She didn&#x2019;t reply.

He strode to his shiny police car to begin his evening drive around, knowing all was well. The locals were subdued and the men asleep, for there was a chance of victory the next day on the football field.</p><p>He stopped his car in the main street to peruse the buildings, silver-roofed and smoky. Fog tiptoed around them, gathering around gateposts and walls, standing like gossamer marquees between trees. Muffled conversation wandered from the Station Hotel. He studied the vehicles nosing the pub: the usual Morris Minors and Austins, a utility, Councillor Pettyman&#x2019;s Wolseley and the Beaumonts&#x2019; imposing but tired Triumph Gloria.</p><p>A Greyhound bus rumbled and hissed to a standstill outside the post office, its headlights illuminating Sergeant Farrat&#x2019;s pale face.</p><p>&#x2018;A passenger?&#x2019; he said aloud.</p><p>The door of the bus swung open and the glow from the interior beam struggled out. A slim young woman stepped lightly into the fog. Her hair was lush about her shoulders, and she wore a beret and an unusually cut overcoat. &#x2018;Very smart,&#x2019; thought the sergeant.</p><p>The driver pulled a suitcase from the luggage boot and carried it to the post office porch, leaving it in the dark corner. He went back for another, then another, and then he pulled something else out &#x2013; something with a domed cover with &#x2018;Singer&#x2019; printed in gold letters across its side.</p><p>The passenger stood holding it, looking over to the creek then up and down the street.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh my pretty hat,&#x2019; said Sergeant Farrat, and shot from his car.</p><p>She heard the car door slam so turned on her heel and headed west, towards The Hill. Behind her the bus roared away, the tail-lights shrinking, but she could hear the footsteps approaching.</p><p>&#x2018;Myrtle Dunnage, my, my.&#x2019;</p><p>Myrtle quickened her pace. So did Sergeant Farrat. He inspected her fine boots &#x2013; <i>Italian?</i> he wondered &#x2013; and her trousers, definitely not serge.</p><p>&#x2018;Myrtle, let me help you.&#x2019;</p><p>She walked on, so the sergeant lunged, wrenching the domed box from her hand, spinning her around. They stood and stared at each other, the white air swirling around them. Tilly had grown into a woman while Sergeant Farrat had aged. He raised one pale hand to his mouth in embarrassment, then shrugged and headed for his car with the luggage. When he&#x2019;d thrown the last of Myrtle&#x2019;s suitcases onto the back seat, he opened the passenger door for her and waited. When she was in he swung the car about and headed east. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll take the long way home,&#x2019; he said. The knot in the pit of Tilly&#x2019;s stomach hardened.</p><p>They glided through the fog and as they rounded the football oval, Sergeant Farrat said, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re third from the top of the ladder this year.&#x2019;</p><p>Tilly was silent.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ve come from Melbourne, have you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; she answered flatly.</p><p>&#x2018;Home for long?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not sure.&#x2019;</p><p>They drove back through the main street. When they passed the school hall she heard the childhood cries of Friday afternoon softball games and shrieks and splashes from swimming carnivals at the creek. When Sergeant Farrat turned the library corner towards The Hill, she smelled the library&#x2019;s waxed lino floor, and saw a flash of wet blood on the dry grass outside. Memories of being driven to the bus stop all those years ago by the same man rose up, and the knot in her stomach turned.</p><p>Finally the police car ground its way to the top of The Hill and stopped. She sat looking at her old home while the sergeant looked at her. Little Myrtle Dunnage had alabaster skin and her mother&#x2019;s eyes and hair. She seemed strong, but damaged.</p><p>&#x2018;Does anyone know you&#x2019;re coming, Myrtle?&#x2019; asked the sergeant.</p><p>&#x2018;My name is Tilly,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Everyone will know soon enough.&#x2019;</p><p>She turned to look at Sergeant Farrat&#x2019;s expectant face in the foggy moonlight. &#x2018;How is my mother?&#x2019; she asked.</p><p>He opened his car door. &#x2018;Your mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doesn&#x2019;t get out these days,&#x2019; he said, and climbed from the car. The fog resting around the veranda moved like frills on a skirt as the sergeant moved through it with Tilly&#x2019;s suitcases. He held the heavy dome. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve a lovely sewing machine, <i>Tilly</i>,&#x2019; he said.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m a seamstress and dressmaker, Sergeant Farrat.&#x2019; She opened the back door.</p><p>He clapped his hands. &#x2018;Excellent!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Thanks for the lift.&#x2019; She closed the back door on him.</p><p>As he drove away, Sergeant Farrat tried to remember the last time he&#x2019;d visited Mad Molly. He hadn&#x2019;t seen her for at least a year, but knew Mae McSwiney kept an eye on her. He smiled. &#x2018;A dressmaker!&#x2019;</p><p>Molly&#x2019;s house was dank and smelled like possum piss. Tilly felt along the dusty wall for the light switch and turned it on, then moved through the kitchen to the lounge room, past the crusty old lounge suite to the fireplace. She put her hand to the ash. It was stone cold. She made her way over to her mother&#x2019;s bedroom door, turned the knob and pushed. A dull lamp glowed in the corner by the bed.</p><p>&#x2018;Mum?&#x2019;</p><p>A body stirred under piled blankets. A skeleton head wearing a tea cosy turned on a grubby kapok pillow. The mouth gaped like a charcoal hole, and sunken eyes gazed at her.</p><p>Molly Dunnage, mad woman and crone, said to her daughter, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve come about the dog, have you? You can&#x2019;t have him. We want to keep him.&#x2019;</p><p>She gestured at a crowd of invisible people around her bed. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t we?&#x2019; She nodded at them.</p><p>&#x2018;This is what they&#x2019;ve done to you,&#x2019; said Tilly.</p><p>A mitten, stiff and soiled, came from under the blankets. Molly looked at her skinny wrist. &#x2018;Half past four,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>Tilly unpacked the bottle of brandy she&#x2019;d bought for her mother and sat on the back veranda looking down at the dull forms of Dungatar at slumber. She wondered about what she had left behind her, and what she had returned to.</p><p>At dawn she sighed and raised a glass to the small grey town and went inside. She evicted snug families of mice from between the towels in the linen press and spiders from their lace homes under light shades. She swept dust, dirt, twigs and a dead sparrow from the bath and turned on the taps to scrub it. The water ran cold and brown and when it flowed clear and hot, she filled the bath, then added lavender flowers from the garden. She tugged her mother from her crusty bed and pulled her tottering towards the bath. Mad Molly cursed, scratched and punched Tilly with Daddy Long Legs limbs, but soon tired and folded easily into the water.</p><p>&#x2018;Anyway,&#x2019; she snapped, &#x2018;everyone knows red jelly stays harder longer,&#x2019; and she cackled at Tilly with green gums and lunatic eyes.</p><p>&#x2018;Give me your teeth,&#x2019; said Tilly. Molly clamped her mouth shut. Tilly pressed Molly&#x2019;s forearms across her chest, pinning her, then pinched her nostrils until Molly opened her mouth to breathe. She prised the teeth out with a spoon and dropped them into a bucket of ammonia. Molly yelled and thrashed about until she was exhausted and clean and, while she soaked, Tilly stripped the beds. When the sun was high she dragged the mattresses out onto the grass to bake.</p><p>Later she tucked Molly&#x2019;s scrawny frame back into bed and spooned her sweet black tea, talking to her all the while. Molly&#x2019;s answers were maniacal, angry, but answers just the same. Then she slept, so Tilly cleaned out the stove, gathered kindling from the garden and lit a fire. Smoke ballooned up the chimney and a possum in the roof thumped across the beams. She threw open all the doors and windows and started flinging things out &#x2013; an ancient sewing machine and a moth-eaten dress stand, a wringer washing machine shell, old newspapers and boxes, dirty curtains and stiff carpet pieces, a couch and its ruined chairs, broken tables, empty tin cans and glass bottles. Soon the little weatherboard house stood stump deep in rubbish.</p><p>When Molly woke, Tilly walked her all the way down to the outhouse where she sat her on the toilet with her bloomers around her ankles and her nightie tucked up into her jumper. She tied her hands to the toilet door with her dressing gown cord so that she would not wander off. Molly bellowed at the top of her old lungs until she was hoarse. Later, Tilly heated tinned tomato soup and sat her mother in the sun &#x2013; emptied, cleaned and wrapped in jumpers, gloves, cap, socks, slippers and blankets &#x2013; and fed her. All the while Mad Molly prattled. Tilly wiped her mother&#x2019;s sauce-red mouth. &#x2018;Did you enjoy that?&#x2019;</p><p>Her mother replied formally, &#x2018;Yes thank you, we always do,&#x2019; and smiled graciously to the others attending the banquet, before vomiting over the strange woman she thought was feeding her poison.</p><p>Again Tilly stood on the veranda, the breeze pressing her trousers against her slim legs. Below her, smoke circled from beneath a copper in the McSwineys&#x2019; yard at the base of The Hill beside the tip. Strangers assumed the bent railway carriages and dented caravans were part of it, but it was where the McSwiney family lived. Edward McSwiney was Dungatar&#x2019;s night cart man. He could negotiate every outhouse, every full dunny can in Dungatar &#x2013; even on the blackest, windiest nights &#x2013; without spilling a drop. During the day he also delivered things, riding around on his cart with his middle son Barney and a bunch of kids hanging off the back.</p><p>Little Myrtle used to watch the McSwiney kids playing: the oldest boy, a few years younger than herself, then three girls and Barney, who was &#x2018;not quite finished&#x2019;. He was crooked, with an upside-down head and a club foot.</p><p>The town itself rested in the full glare of the morning sun. The railway station and the square, grey silo sat along the railway line, whose arc held the buildings against the bend of the Dungatar creek, like freckles on a nose. The creek had always been low, choked with willows and cumbungi weed, the flow sluggish and the water singing with mosquitos. The pioneer founders of Dungatar had allowed a flood plain along its inner curve, which was now a park of sorts with a community hall in the middle, Mr and Mrs Almanac&#x2019;s low damp cottage at the eastern end opposite their chemist shop, and the school at the western edge, where Prudence Dimm had taught the children of Dungatar for as long as anyone could remember. The main road followed the curve of the park, separating it from the commercial strip. The police station was situated out along the road to the east, halfway between the cemetery and the town&#x2019;s edge. It was not a busy road and there were few shops at its kerb, the chemist shop, then the Station Hotel, and then A and M Pratt, Merchant Supplies &#x2013; a general store which sold everything anyone needed. The post office, bank and telephone exchange were housed together in the next building, and the last, most western building was the shire office and library combined. The houses of Dungatar, dotted behind the commercial strip, were dissected by a thin gravel road that ran to the football oval.</p><p>The green eye of the oval looked back up at Tilly, the cars around its edge like lashes. Inside, her mother stirred and called, and the possum thumped across the ceiling again.</p><p>Tilly went to the dress stand lying on the grass. She stood it up and then hosed it down, leaving it to dry in the sun.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On Saturday mornings the main street of Dungatar sang to the chug of farm trucks and solid British automobiles bearing smart pastoralist families. Younger children were passed into the care of older siblings, and sent to the park so mothers could shop and gossip. Men stood in clumps talking about the weather and looking to the sky, and thin-skinned, thick-boned women in floral sunfrocks and felt hats sat behind trestle tables selling raffle tickets.</p><p>Sergeant Farrat made his way past a young man slouched behind the wheel of a dusty Triumph Gloria and across the road towards Pratts. He encountered Mona Beaumont on the footpath outside.</p><p>&#x2018;Good morning, Mona,&#x2019; he called. &#x2018;I see you have your brother safely at home.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Mother sa-ays we can let the dreadful hired help go. That Mr Mac-Swiney&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019; Mona had a way of making words flat and long so Sergeant Farrat always used his most melodious vowels when he spoke to her. &#x2018;Not too hasty, Mona. There&#x2019;s a fair chance William will be snapped up by one of our eligible spinsters before long.&#x2019; He smiled mischievously. &#x2018;You might find he&#x2019;s busy elsewhere.&#x2019;</p><p>Mona shrank a little sideways and picked at the pilling on her cardigan cuff. &#x2018;Mother sa-ays the girls around here are un-refined.&#x2019;</p><p>Sergeant Farrat looked at Mona&#x2019;s tweed beret sitting on top of her head like a dead cat, her posture laden and graceless. &#x2018;On the contrary, Mona, history has made us all independent, these are progressive times &#x2013; it&#x2019;s an advantage to be adept, especially in the fairer sex&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>Mona giggled at the sex word.</p><p>&#x2018;. . . take for example the Pratt women: they know nuts and bolts and powders that are lethal to maggots in flystruck merinos, also stock feed and the treatment for chicken lice, haberdashery, fruit preservatives and female intimate apparel.

Gertrude tended to groceries and dry goods. She tied every package with string, which she snapped with her bare fingers: a telling skill the sergeant thought. Mrs Muriel Pratt was the expert in haberdashery and hardware. People whispered that she was more suited to hardware. The smallgoods and butchery were in the far back corner of the shop, where Reginald carved and sawed carcasses and forced mince into sheep intestine, then arranged his sausages neatly against circles of trimmed loin chops. Mr Alvin Pratt had a courteous manner, but he was mean. He collected the account dockets from the counter three times a day and filed the debts alphabetically in his glass office. Customers usually turned their backs to him while Gertrude weighed up rolled oats or fetched Aspros, because he would pull files from big wooden drawers and slowly turn the blue-lined pages while they waited.</p><p>...</p></p><h2>Body &amp; Soul: Reclaiming the Heidelberg Catechism</h2><p>In this groundbreaking book, theologian, pastor, and popular author M. Craig Barnes reveals the Heidelberg Catechism's true identity. It's not a list of doctrinal questions and answers. It's not a cut-and-dried summary of what Christians believe. It's a deeply personal statement of faith and a surprisingly contemporary guide for everyday life.<br><br>You'll find that this 450-year-old confession is a reliable and inspiring companion in a world where faith and doubt coexist. You'll also find comfort in belonging, body and soul, to the triune God.</p><p>M. Craig Barnes is a pastor, a professor, and president of Princeton Theological Seminary.The work of pastors and the work of theologians have been 'put asunder' by far too many in the American church, impoverishing both vocations. Craig Barnes uses the Heidelberg Catechism as a loom to skillfully weave them into a seamless garment. This is a rare work of beauty and blessing. --Eugene Peterson<br><br>Craig Barnes is one of the most thoughtful and engaging minds around. <em>Body &amp; Soul</em> will be a feast for your heart and mind.

The Catechism is a gift to the church, and so is Barnes' clear and illuminating book. Seekers, newcomers, and old hands in the church all will benefit from his thoughtful reflections. --Dr. Richard Lischer, Duke Divinity School<br><br>Craig Barnes is one of the most thoughtful and engaging minds around. <em>Body &amp; Soul</em> will be a feast for your heart and mind.

The author and illustrator of <i>I'm a Big Sister</i> (1997) and <i>I'm a Big Brother</i> (1997) offer <i>Inside Mommy</i> , classified as fact, begins with a simple explanation of a baby's development in the mother's uterus. It goes on to show the baby's birth, followed by his growth to a child of perhaps three or four years old. An appended "Note to Parents" offers a sound approach to talking with children: "Why should the discussion have a serious, instructional tone? Keep it light and warm." <i>Go to Work</i> , which is classified as fiction, reflects a child's day care experience, including the morning routine at home, the separation anxiety, the fun at day care, and finally, the parents' return. The first-person text ends, "Do you know what? Miss Terri and Mr. Ken were right. Mommy and Daddy <i>did</i> come back. They always do." A page of practical tips is appended. The simplicity and sensitivity of the writing is well matched by Chambliss' line and watercolor wash illustrations. The gentle colors and benevolent portrayals of characters help create a reassuring tone that makes the books natural starting places for family discussions. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For many, it was a time and place where opportunities were limited by social and legal constraints that were beyond their control. It was a time and place where few dared to dream. Based on his own life experience, Pulitzer nominee Clifton Taulbert has teamed up with entrepreneur thought leader Gary Schoeniger to create a powerful and compelling story that captures the essence of an entrepreneurial mindset and the unlimited opportunities it can provide. Drawing on the entrepreneurial life lessons Taulbert learned from his Uncle Cleve, Who Owns the Ice house? chronicles Taulbert&#x2019;s journey from life in the Mississippi Delta at the height of legal segregation to being recognized by Time magazine as "one of our nation&#x2019;s most outstanding emerging entrepreneurs." Who Owns The Ice House? reaches into the past to remind us of the timeless and universal principles that can empower anyone to succeed.</p><p>Clifton L. Taulbert, a recognized thought leader on the power of community, is renowned for his ability to glean timeless lessons from the place of his birth, the Mississippi Delta. His first book, "Once upon a Time When We Were Colored" has been embraced globally as has his book, "Eight Habits of the Heart". Taulbert&#x2019;s "Last Train North" was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and received the Doublday New Author of the Year award and the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters award for non-fiction.

The score is included in this book so that you can learn to play and sing and shine your light for everyone to see.</p><p>E.B. Lewis&nbsp;is the award-winning illustrator of such books as&nbsp;<i>Virgie Goes to School with Us Boys</i>&nbsp;by Elizabeth Fitzgerald, which was a Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor Book, and&nbsp;<i>This Little Light of Mine</i>. He received the Caldecott Honor for&nbsp;<i>Coming on Home Soon</i>&nbsp;by Jacqueline Woodson and the Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award for&nbsp;<i>Talkin&#x2019; About Bessie: The Story of Aviator Elizabeth Coleman</i>&nbsp;by Nikki Grimes. E.B. Lewis lives in New Jersey, and you can visit him online at EBLewis.com.PreS-Gr. 2. Lewis illustrates this familiar African American spiritual with a series of full-page and double-page watercolor paintings that create sun-dappled outdoor scenes and portray individual characters with equal finesse. Each painting interprets phrases from the song within the framework of a "wordless" story in which a boy walks from his home to a ball field, stopping along the way to greet and help others in his rural, African American community. The pictures do not illustrate the words in the traditional sense, but they form a visual counterpoint that enriches the verse by making it more concrete and meaningful to young children. In keeping with the refrain of the spiritual, light fills the pictures, brightening and warming the day and shining from the face of the boy and the people he meets. Adults who interpret the song's "light" in terms of God's presence or gifts will find the book a good vehicle for sharing those thoughts, but children will find the simple visual storyline satisfying as well. The book concludes with the musical score with notes, chords, and four verses. Painted with spirit and grace, this is one picture book that should always be sung. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

While most said they still believe that the Bible is God's Word, they also said that the idea that the earth is millions of years old was one thing that caused them to doubt the bible? The crumbling foundation of the church takes a devastating toll on future generations. Therefore, churches must reclaim the historical truth found in Genesis and apply the Bible's authority to every area of life."<br> -Ken Ham, President<br> <em>Answers in Genesis</em></p><p>As the modern Church struggles to find a place of relevancy for a new generation that already has massive demands on its time and attention, more and more young people raised in the Church are leaving it - failing to find the answers to their questions of faith and life, beset with doubts raised by issues that the Church chooses not to address. Opting to skirt the controversy of Genesis as literal history, the biblical authority of the Holy Word is called into question and reduced to a collection of mere stories. More popularly considered an issue for schools or in the public realm, the conflicting views on the age of the earth also remain a pivotal issue within the Church - as it has for over two centuries.</p><ul><li>Was the Creation week literally six days?</li><li>Does science really point to an old earth?</li><li>Does the issue really matter for Christians?</li><li>Should this issue even be discussed within the Church?</li></ul><p>Join authors Dr. Jason Lisle and Tim Chaffey as they put forth a case against an old-earth interpretation of Scripture.

Marx not only stood against the global economic system but he also helped us understand it. He explained how wealth was created on the backs of workers, how "surplus value" is realized and how accumulation is achieved through unpaid labour-time, the intensification of work and the tyranny of credit.<br><br> "Capital - In Manga!" is the English translation of the Japanese bestseller. It's a story of a cheese-maker turned capitalist and how greed, exploitation and its social consequences destroys lives and remakes workers into commodities.<br><br> It is hoped that this manga may act as a bridge to Marx's original work.</p><p></p><h2>The Honest-to-Goodness Truth</h2><p><b>If telling the truth is the right thing to do, why is the whole world mad at Libby?</b><br><br>&#x201c;Tell the truth and shame the devil,&#x201d; Libby&#x2019;s mama has told her.

By now, no one is talking to Libby. Perplexed and glum, she turns to her mama for another lesson on telling the truth. But it isn't until Libby gets a small spoonful of her own medicine that she really grasps the difference between the right way and the wrong way to tell the truth.<p> Children know just how difficult it is to find that balance between a lie and the honest-to-goodness truth. Award-winning author Patricia McKissack teams up with acclaimed illustrator Giselle Potter (<i>Gabriella's Song</i>, <i>When Agnes Caws</i>) to create a witty, touching story that will sound quite familiar to anyone who has ever struggled with just this quandary. Potter's unique, naive style is terrifically appealing, with her big-faced, highly expressive characters and gorgeous gouache and gesso colors. (Ages 5 to 10) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>"TELL thE tRuth AND ShAME thE DEVIL", Libby's mama has told her. So whatever is Libby doing wrong? Ever since she started telling only the truth, the whole world seems to be mad at her. First it's her best friend, Ruthie Mae, who gets upset when Libby tells all their friends that Ruthie Mae has a hole in her sock. Then Willie gives her an ugly look when she tells the teacher he hasn't done his homework. It seems that telling the truth isn't always so simple.<p>Children will sympathize with Libby as she struggles to figure out that even though its' always wrong to tell a lie, there's a right and a wrong way to tell the truth. Giselle Potter's naively stubborn illustrations perfectly capture this humorous and poignant story by award-winning author Patricia C. McKissack.</p></p><h2>Practical Origami: Folding Your Way to Everyday Accessories</h2><p>With Practical Origami a world of simple useful designs await.

Ford is an award-winning short-story writer, an alumnus of the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, and a survivor of Orson Scott Card&#x2019;s Literary Boot Camp. Having grown up near Seattle&#x2019;s Chinatown, he now lives in Montana with his wife and children.The Panama Hotel (1986)<br><br>Old Henry Lee stood transfixed by all the commotion at the Panama Hotel. What had started as a crowd of curious onlookers eyeballing a television news crew had now swollen into a polite mob of shoppers, tourists, and a few punk-looking street kids, all wondering what the big deal was. In the middle of the crowd stood Henry, shopping bags hanging at his side. He felt as if he were waking from a long forgotten dream. A dream he&#x2019;d once had as a little boy.<br><br>The old Seattle landmark was a place he&#x2019;d visited twice in his lifetime. First when he was only twelve years old, way back in 1942&#x2014;&#x201c;the war years&#x201d; he liked to call them. Even then the old bachelor hotel had stood as a gateway between Seattle&#x2019;s Chinatown and Nihonmachi, Japantown. Two outposts of an old-world conflict&#x2014;where Chinese and Japanese immigrants rarely spoke to one another, while their American-born children often played kick the can in the streets together. The hotel had always been a perfect landmark. A perfect meeting place&#x2014;where he&#x2019;d once met the love of his life.<br><br>The second time was today. It was 1986, what, forty-plus years later? He&#x2019;d stopped counting the years as they slipped into memory. After all, he&#x2019;d spent a lifetime between these bookended visits. A marriage. The birth of an ungrateful son. Cancer, and a burial. He missed his wife, Ethel. She&#x2019;d been gone six months now. But he didn&#x2019;t miss her as much as you&#x2019;d think, as bad as that might sound. It was more like quiet relief really. Her health had been bad&#x2014;no, worse than bad. The cancer in her bones had been downright crippling, to both of us, he thought.<br><br>For the last seven years Henry had fed her, bathed her, helped her to the bathroom when she needed to go, and back again when she was all through. He took care of her night and day, 24/7 as they say these days. Marty, his son, thought his mother should have been put in a home, but Henry would have none of it. &#x201c;Not in my lifetime,&#x201d; Henry said, resisting. Not just because he was Chinese (though that was a part of his resistance). The Confucian ideal of filial piety&#x2014;respect and reverence for one&#x2019;s parents&#x2014;was a cultural relic not easily discarded by Henry&#x2019;s generation. He&#x2019;d been raised to care for loved ones, personally, and to put someone in a home was unacceptable. What his son, Marty, never fully understood was that deep down there was an Ethel-shaped hole in Henry&#x2019;s life, and without her, all he felt was the draft of loneliness, cold and sharp, the years slipping away like blood from a wound that never heals.<br><br>Now she was gone for good. She needed to be buried, Henry thought, the traditional Chinese way, with food offerings, longevity blankets, and prayer ceremonies lasting several days&#x2014;despite Marty&#x2019;s fit about cremating her. He was so modern. He&#x2019;d been seeing a counselor and dealing with his mother&#x2019;s death through an online support group, whatever that was. Going online sounded like talking to no one, which Henry had some firsthand experience in&#x2014;in real life. It was lonely. Almost as lonely as Lake View Cemetery, where he&#x2019;d buried Ethel. She now had a gorgeous view of Lake Washington, and was interred with Seattle&#x2019;s other Chinese notables, like Bruce Lee and his own son, Brandon. But in the end, each of them occupied a solitary grave. Alone forever. It didn&#x2019;t matter who your neighbors were. They didn&#x2019;t talk back.<br><br>When night fell, and it did, Henry chatted with his wife, asking her how her day was. She never replied, of course. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not crazy or anything,&#x201d; Henry would say to no one, &#x201c;just open-minded. You never know who&#x2019;s listening.&#x201d; Then he&#x2019;d busy himself pruning his Chinese palm or evergreen&#x2014;houseplants whose brown leaves confessed his months of neglect. But now he had time once again. Time to care for something that would grow stronger for a change.<br><br>Occasionally, though, he&#x2019;d wonder about statistics. Not the cancer mortality rates that had caught up with dear Ethel. Instead he thought about himself, and his time measured on some life insurance actuarial table. He was only fifty-six&#x2014;a young man by his own standards. But he&#x2019;d read in Newsweek about the inevitable decline in the health of a surviving spouse his age. Maybe the clock was ticking? He wasn&#x2019;t sure, because as soon as Ethel passed, time began to crawl, clock or no clock.<br><br>He&#x2019;d agreed to an early retirement deal at Boeing Field and now had all the time in the world, and no one to share the hours with. No one with whom to walk down to the Mon Hei bakery for yuet beng, carrot mooncakes, on cool autumn evenings.<br><br>Instead here he was, alone in a crowd of strangers. A man between lifetimes, standing at the foot of the Panama Hotel once again. Following the cracked steps of white marble that made the hotel look more like an Art Deco halfway house. The establishment, like Henry, seemed caught between worlds. Still, Henry felt nervous and excited, just like he had been as a boy, whenever he walked by. He&#x2019;d heard a rumor in the marketplace and wandered over from the video store on South Jackson. At first he thought there was some kind of accident because of the growing size of the crowd. But he didn&#x2019;t hear or see anything, no sirens wailing, no flashing lights. Just people drifting toward the hotel, like the tide going out, pulling at their feet, propelling them forward, one step at a time.<br><br>As Henry walked over, he saw a news crew arrive and followed them inside. The crowd parted as camera-shy onlookers politely stepped away, clearing a path. Henry followed right behind, shuffling his feet so as not to step on anyone, or in turn be stepped upon, feeling the crowd press back in behind him. At the top of the steps, just inside the lobby, the hotel&#x2019;s new owner announced, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve found something in the basement.&#x201d;<br><br>Found what? A body perhaps? Or a drug lab of some kind? No, there&#x2019;d be police officers taping off the area if the hotel were a crime scene.<br><br>Before the new owner, the hotel had been boarded up since 1950, and in those years, Chinatown had become a ghetto gateway for tongs&#x2014;gangs from Hong Kong and Macau. The city blocks south of King Street had a charming trashiness by day; the litter and slug trails on the sidewalk were generally overlooked as tourists peered up at egg-and-dart architecture from another era. Children on field trips, wrapped in colorful coats and hats, held hands as they followed their noses to the mouthwatering sight of barbecue duck in the windows, hanging red crayons melting in the sun. But at night, drug dealers and bony, middle-aged hookers working for dime bags haunted the streets and alleys. The thought of this icon of his childhood becoming a makeshift crack house made him ache with a melancholy he hadn&#x2019;t felt since he held Ethel&#x2019;s hand and watched her exhale, long and slow, for the last time.<br><br>Precious things just seemed to go away, never to be had again.<br><br>As he took off his hat and began fanning himself with the threadbare brim, the crowd pushed forward, pressing in from the rear. Flashbulbs went off. Standing on his tippy toes, he peered over the shoulder of the tall news reporter in front of him.<br><br>The new hotel owner, a slender Caucasian woman, slightly younger than Henry, walked up the steps holding . . . an umbrella? She popped it open, and Henry&#x2019;s heart beat a little faster as he saw it for what it was. A Japanese parasol, made from bamboo, bright red and white&#x2014;with orange koi painted on it, carp that looked like giant goldfish. It shed a film of dust that floated, suspended momentarily in the air as the hotel owner twirled the fragile-looking artifact for the cameras. Two more men brought up a steamer trunk bearing the stickers of foreign ports: Admiral Oriental Lines out of Seattle and Yokohama, Tokyo. On the side of the trunk was the name Shimizu, hand-painted in large white letters. It was opened for the curious crowd. Inside were clothing, photo albums, and an old electric rice cooker. The new hotel owner explained that in the basement she had discovered the belongings of thirty-seven Japanese families who she presumed had been persecuted and taken away. Their belongings had been hidden and never recovered&#x2014;a time capsule from the war years.<br><br>Henry stared in silence as a small parade of wooden packing crates and leathery suitcases were hauled upstairs, the crowd marveling at the once-precious items held within: a white communion dress, tarnished silver candlesticks, a picnic basket&#x2014;items that had collected dust, untouched, for forty-plus years. Saved for a happier time that never came.<br><br>The more Henry thought about the shabby old knickknacks, the forgotten treasures, the more he wondered if his own broken heart might be found in there, hidden among the unclaimed possessions of another time. Boarded up in the basement of a condemned hotel. Lost, but never forgotten.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Not One Damsel in Distress: Heroic Girls from World Folklore</h2><p><b>From celebrated&nbsp;author Jane Yolen comes this inspiring collection of folktales from around the world, all featuring strong female heroes.</b><br><br> These fifteen folktales have one thing in common: brainy, bold, brave women&#x2014;and not one damsel in distress!

The &#34;prize&#34; they sought was not civil rights, but human rights. Only the human rights lexicon, shaped by the Holocaust and articulated by the United Nations, contained the language and the moral power to address not only the political and legal inequality but also the education, health care, housing, and employment needs that haunted the black community. The NAACP understood this and wielded its influence and resources to take its human rights agenda before the United Nations. But the onset of the Cold War and rising anti-communism allowed powerful southerners to cast those rights as Soviet-inspired and a threat to the American &#34;ways of life.&#34; Enemies and friends excoriated the movement, and the NAACP retreated to a narrow civil rights agenda that was easier to maintain politically. Thus the Civil Rights Movement was launched with neither the language nor the mission it needed to truly achieve black equality. Carol Anderson is the recipient of major grants from the Ford Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies, and numerous awards for excellence in teaching. Her scholarly interests are 20th century American, African-American, and diplomatic history, and the impact of the Cold War and U.S. foreign policy on the struggle for black equality in particular. Her publications include &#34;From Hope to Disillusion published in Diplomatic History and reprinted in The African-American Voice in U.S. Foreign Policy.</p><p>In the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust, African American leaders, led by the NAACP, went before the United Nations to fight against against the conditions of segregation and inequality in the United States. The &#39;prize&#39; they sought was not political or &#39;civil&#39; rights, it was human rights including the right to education, health care, housing, and employment. But the onset of the Cold War allowed powerful Southerners to cast those rights as Soviet-inspired, forcing the NAACP to take up a limited, civil rights agenda."Carol Anderson has written the most thoroughly researched and interpretively sophisticated monograph on Cold War civil rights. Eyes Off the Prize is destined to become a benchmark for the field." David Levering Lewis, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of W.E.B. DuBois<br><br>"An outstanding and timely study. Meticulously researched, boldly written, and persuasively argued, it clearly illustrates exactly where and precisely how the broadly based NAACP program of human rights got eviscerated during the 1940s and early 1950s, producing a narrowly focused and tantalizingly inadequate series of civil rights measures. Above all this book emphasizes the blatant ways in which the issue of race indelibly permeates all aspects of politics, society and economy in the United States." Franklin W. Knight, Leonard and Helen R. Stulman Professor, Johns Hopkins University<br><br>"Carol Anderson, has written an exciting political narrative history of African-American attempts to raise the issue of human rights before the United Nations in order to attack de jure and de facto segregation and racism in the US in the early post World War II period.

Canadian Journal of History/Annales canadiennes d'histoire, Norman D. Markowitz, Rutgers University<br><br>"This narrative of the NAACP challenges conventional interpretations of how America's foremost civil rights organization negotiated the dangerous currents of the Cold War.

Kenny tells the story of philosophy chronologically, his lively narrative bringing the great philosophers to life and filling in the historical and intellectual background to their work. Kenny also looks closely at each of the main areas of philosophical exploration: knowledge and understanding; science; metaphysics; mind and soul; the nature and content of morality; political philosophy; and God. <em>A New History of Western Philosophy</em> is a stimulating chronicle of the intellectual development of Western civilization, allowing readers to trace the birth and growth of philosophy from antiquity to the present day.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sir Anthony Kenny</strong> is one of Britain's most distinguished academic figures.

This book gives a succinct explanation of his metaphysical system, concentrating on the original aspects of his thought, which inspired many artists and thinkers including Nietzsche, Wagner, Freud, and Wittgenstein. Schopenhauer's central notion is that of the will--a blind, irrational force that he uses to interpret both the human mind and the whole of nature. Seeing human behavior as that of a natural organism governed by the will to life, Schopenhauer developed radical insights concerning the unconscious and sexuality which influenced both psychologists and philosophers<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Janaway</strong> is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Birbeck College, University of London.<br>`an excellent brief introduction to Schopenhauer's thought - well-written, concise, and pitched at just the right level.'<br>Christopher Norris, University of Wales</p><h2>The Quotable Osler</h2><p>He has been the subject of many articles and books, and Oslerian Societies around the world meet regularly to discuss his legacy.

While other ex-slaves and many poor whites became trapped in the exploitative sharecropping system, these independence-seeking individuals settled on pockets of unclaimed land that had been deemed too poor for farming and turned them into successful family farms. In these self-sufficient rural communities, often known as "freedom colonies," African Americans created a refuge from the discrimination and violence that routinely limited the opportunities of blacks in the Jim Crow South.</p><p>Freedom Colonies is the first book to tell the story of these independent African American settlements. Thad Sitton and James Conrad focus on communities in Texas, where blacks achieved a higher percentage of land ownership than in any other state of the Deep South. The authors draw on a vast reservoir of ex-slave narratives, oral histories, written memoirs, and public records to describe how the freedom colonies formed and to recreate the lifeways of African Americans who made their living by farming or in skilled trades such as milling and blacksmithing. They also uncover the forces that led to the decline of the communities from the 1930s onward, including economic hard times and the greed of whites who found legal and illegal means of taking black-owned land. And they visit some of the remaining communities to discover how their independent way of life endures into the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Thad Sitton is a historian of anthropological background and training, specializing in studies of rural Texas during the first half of the twentieth century. Three of Sitton&#x2019;s books won the coveted T. R. Fehrenbach Award of the Texas Historical Commission, and his history of freedmen&#x2019;s settlements received a major prize from the Texas Institute of Letters. In 2001, he received the Thomas L. Charlton Lifetime Achievement Award from the Texas Oral History Association."Thad Sitton and James H. Conrad have made an important contribution to African American and southern history with their study of communities fashioned by freedmen in the years after emancipation." (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"This study is a thoughtful and important addition to an understanding of rural Texas and the nature of black settlements." (<i>Journal of Southern History</i>)<br><br>"This book is the first of its kind. . . . Blacks emerge as thinkers and actors on the stage; that is, they were not merely passive victims; rather, they made their own history by building their own communities and by becoming free farmers."

Guide, Murphy reveals the stark truth: free market failure didn&#39;t cause the Great Depression and the New Deal didn&#39;t cure it. Shattering myths and politically correct lies, he tells why World War II didn t help the economy or get us out of the Great Depression; why it took FDR to make the Depression Great; and why Herbert Hoover was more like Obama and less like Bush than the liberal media would have you believe. Free-market believers and capitalists everywhere should have this on their bookshelf and in their briefcases.</p><p>Bad times are here again...and so too are bad ideas on how to fix them.<p>No economic myth these days is more pernicious than the myth that the free market caused the Great Depression and the New Deal got us out of it. That, as economist Robert P. Murphy points out is flat-out false. In <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal</i> he provides irrefutable evidence that not only did government interference with the market cause the Great Depression (and our current economic collapse), but Herbert Hoover's and Franklin Delano Roosevelt's big government policies afterwards made it much longer and much worse (just as President Barack Obama's extraordinary expansion of government promises to do today). Perhaps even more compelling, Murphy exposes the untold story behind the New Deal--how it operated by force, and why what's really at stake is not only our economy but our liberty. </p><p>Praise for <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal.</i></p>"A thorough and impressive critique of FDR and the New Deal which should be required reading in all modern U.S. history and economics courses. I highly recommend this insightful book."<br>--Burton W. Folsom, Jr., Professor of History, Hillsdale College and author of <i>New Deal or Raw Deal?: How FDR's Economic Legacy Has Damaged America</i><p>"Robert P. Murphy's splendid guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal is a clear, compelling account of an era that even most economists get wrong. Now that many people are clamoring for a rerun of the New Deal, you owe it to yourself to find out what such a sequel would entail. Murphy's book is the best place to begin your quest."<br>--Robert Higgs, Senior Fellow in Political Economy, The Independent Institute</p>"Today's central planners cower from the truth about the Great Depression and the New Deal like Dracula before a crucifix. Robert Murphy eviscerates the fantasy version of these episodes that is used to justify destructive and idiotic policies today. You almost feel sorry for the propagandists while reading this book. Almost."<br>--Thomas E. Woods, Ph.D., author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Meltdown: A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse</i><p>"Dr. Murphy explains in insightful fashion why the conventional wisdom is neither conventional nor wisdom. He is not only a good economist but can turn the reader into a good economist."<br>--Gary Wolfram, William Simon Professor of Economics and Public Policy, Hillsdale College</p>"Bob Murphy's Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression provides defenders of liberty the intellectual arsenal they need to counter the myth that capitalism caused, and government cured the Great Depression. Read this book and understand why massively increasing government is not change we can believe in."<br>--Congressman Ron PaulEverything you know about the Great Depression and the New Deal is wrong<p>We all learned in school that the 1920s were a time of unregulated capitalism that led to the stock market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Herbert Hoover was a laissez-faire ideologue who did nothing to alleviate the crisis--even as citizens starved and were forced to live in "Hoovervilles." And the interventionist policies and massive spending programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal gradually lifted us out of the Depression, until World War II brought it to a definitive end.</p>The only trouble with this official narrative--taught in most history textbooks, and proclaimed as gospel by the media--is that every element of it is false. Worse, this unsubstantiated myth is now being used to justify a "new New Deal" in response to today's economic crisis that could lead to a Greater Depression even deeper and longer than the first. But in <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal</i>, economist Robert Murphy fact-checks the myths, shows why they're wrong, and delves deep into history to set the record straight. His "politically incorrect" conclusion? It was government, not free markets, that caused the Great Depression--and the New Deal only made it worse. The real "lessons of the Great Depression" are not what you've been taught.<p>* The Crash of `29 was caused not by capitalism, but by the boom brought on by the newly created Federal Reserve's easy money policy (sound familiar?)<br>* Hoover made the Depression "Great" precisely by abandoning the laissez-faire approach that previous presidents had followed and that kept depressions short<br>* The bank runs of the 1930s were caused by government intervention in the banking system<br>* Government efforts to prop up wages and prices led to a full decade of double-digit unemployment<br>* FDR's arbitrary policies toward businessmen resulted in net investment of less than zero for much of the Depression</p><p>Might Barack Obama be the new FDR? You'll know, after reading <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal</i> that if he is, that's nothing to celebrate.</p></p><h2>Unlikely Warriors: The Army Security Agency&#39;s Secret War in Vietnam 1961-1973</h2><p>In early May 1961, a U.S. military aircraft taxied toward a well-guarded terminal building. The plane slowed to a halt; steps were maneuvered up to its side, and the door was pulled open. The tropical night air was heavy and dank, and the moon shone dimly through high thin clouds. On board the aircraft were ninety-two members of a specially selected team. The men were dressed in indistinguishable dark suits with white shirts and dark ties, and each man carried a new red U.S. diplomatic passport inside his breast pocket. The men held copies of their orders and records in identical brown Manila envelopes, and each man&#39;s medical records were stamped &#34;If injured or killed in combat, report as training accident in the Philippines&#34; In such clandestine fashion, the first fully operational U.S. military unit arrived at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam. The unit was so highly classified even its name was top-secret. It was given a codename, a cover identity to hide the true nature of its mission. The unit&#39;s operation was housed in a heavily-guarded compound near Saigon, and within two days of its arrival, Phase I was implemented. Its operatives were intercepting Viet Cong manual Morse communications, analyzing it for the intelligence it contained and passing the information to the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group-Vietnam. The Army Security Agency was on duty.</p><p>Lonnie M. Long was born in North Carolina and served with the Army Security Agency from August 1962 to November 1965. After completing ASA training at Ft. Devens, Massachusetts, Lonnie served with the 76th Special Operations Unit, Shu Lin Kou Air Station, Taiwan. In 1964, he volunteered for duty in Vietnam and began a fifteen-month tour with the 3rd Radio Research Unit, Aviation Section, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Saigon. Gary B.

I couldn't put it down. Technical detail is presented in easily understandable fashion. Combat situations and emergency details are extremely well portrayed. Accounts of heroism, valor and casualties are accurately described such that the readers feel they are actually there. This book presents tactical signals intelligence in an understandable form that provides a very important body of work to our military history.

Together with schoolmate Joe Shuster, Siegel published several science-fiction fan magazines, and in 1933 they came up with their own science-fiction hero -- Superman. Siegel scripted and Shuster drew several weeks' worth of newspaper strips featuring their new creation, but garnered no interest from publishers or newspaper syndicates. It wasn't until the two established themselves as reliable adventure-strip creators at DC Comics that the editors at DC offered to take a chance on the Superman material -- provided it was re-pasted into comic-book format for DC's new magazine, ACTION COMICS.<br> Siegel wrote the adventures of Superman (as well as other DC heroes, most notably the Spectre, his co-creation with Bernard Baily) through 1948 and then again from 1959-1966, in the interim scripting several newspaper strips including Funnyman and Ken Winston.

In case after case, Sommers shows how these extremists have propped up their arguments with highly questionable but well-funded research, presenting inflammatory and often inaccurate information and stifling any semblance of free and open scrutiny. Trumpeted as orthodoxy, the resulting &#34;findings&#34; on everything from rape to domestic abuse to economic bias to the supposed crisis in girls&#39; self-esteem perpetuate a view of women as victims of the &#34;patriarchy&#34;. Moreover, these arguments and the supposed facts on which they are based have had enormous influence beyond the academy, where they have shaken the foundations of our educational, scientific, and legal institutions and have fostered resentment and alienation in our private lives. Despite its current dominance, Sommers maintains, such a breed of feminism is at odds with the real aspirations and values of most American women and undermines the cause of true equality. Who Stole Feminism? is a call to arms that will enrage or inspire, but cannot be ignored.</p><p><b>Christina Hoff Sommers</b> is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise institute in Washington, D.C.

Together, Stout and Wolfe have entertained&#x2014;and puzzled&#x2014;millions of mystery fans around the world. Now, with his perambulatory man-about-town, Archie Goodwin, the arrogant, gourmandizing, sedentary sleuth is back in the original seventy-three cases of crime and detection written by the inimitable master himself, Rex Stout.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.I<br> &nbsp;<br> The young woman took a pink piece of paper from her handbag, got up from the red leather chair, put the paper on Nero Wolfe&#x2019;s desk, and sat down again. Feeling it my duty to keep myself informed and also to save Wolfe the exertion of leaning forward and reaching so far, I arose and crossed to hand the paper to him after a glance at it. It was a check for five thousand dollars, dated that day, August fourteenth, made out to him, and signed Margaret Mion. He gave a look and dropped it back on the desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;perhaps that would be the best way to start the conversation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In my chair at my desk, taking her in, I was readjusting my attitude. When early that Sunday afternoon, she had phoned for an appointment, I had dug up a vague recollection of a picture of her in the paper some months back, and had decided it would be no treat to meet her, but now I was hedging. Her appeal wasn&#x2019;t what she had, which was only so-so, but what she did with it. I don&#x2019;t mean tricks. Her mouth wasn&#x2019;t attractive even when she smiled, but the smile was. Her eyes were just a pair of brown eyes, nothing at all sensational, but it was a pleasure to watch them move around, from Wolfe to me to the man who had come with her, seated off to her left. I guessed she had maybe three years to go to reach thirty.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think,&#x201d; the man asked her, &#x201c;we should get some questions answered first?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His tone was strained and a little harsh, and his face matched it. He was worried and didn&#x2019;t care who knew it. With his deep-set gray eyes and well-fitted jaw he might on a happier day have passed for a leader of men, but not as he now sat. Something was eating him. When Mrs. Mion had introduced him as Mr. Frederick Weppler I had recognized the name of the music critic of the Gazette, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember whether he had been mentioned in the newspaper accounts of the event that had caused the publication of Mrs. Mion&#x2019;s picture.<br> &nbsp;<br> She shook her head at him, not arbitrarily. &#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t help, Fred, really. We&#x2019;ll just have to tell it and see what he says.&#x201d; She smiled at Wolfe&#x2014;or maybe it wasn&#x2019;t actually a smile, but just her way of handling her lips. &#x201c;Mr. Weppler wasn&#x2019;t quite sure we should come to see you, and I had to persuade him. Men are more cautious than women, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Wolfe agreed, and added, &#x201c;Thank heaven.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She nodded. &#x201c;I suppose so.&#x201d; She gestured. &#x201c;I brought that check with me to show that we really mean it. We&#x2019;re in trouble and we want you to get us out. We want to get married and we can&#x2019;t. That is&#x2014;if I should just speak for myself&#x2014;I want to marry him.&#x201d; She looked at Weppler, and this time it was unquestionably a smile. &#x201c;Do you want to marry me, Fred?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he muttered. Then he suddenly jerked his chin up and looked defiantly at Wolfe. &#x201c;You understand this is embarrassing, don&#x2019;t you? It&#x2019;s none of your business, but we&#x2019;ve come to get your help. I&#x2019;m thirty-four years old, and this is the first time I&#x2019;ve ever been&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped. In a moment he said stiffly, &#x201c;I am in love with Mrs. Mion and I want to marry her more than I have ever wanted anything in my life.&#x201d; His eyes went to his love and he murmured a plea. &#x201c;Peggy!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe grunted. &#x201c;I accept that as proven. You both want to get married. Why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because we can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Peggy said. &#x201c;We simply can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s on account&#x2014;you may remember reading about my husband&#x2019;s death in April, four months ago? Alberto Mion, the opera singer?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Vaguely. You&#x2019;d better refresh my memory.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, he died&#x2014;he killed himself.&#x201d; There was no sign of a smile now. &#x201c;Fred&#x2014;Mr. Weppler and I found him. It was seven o&#x2019;clock, a Tuesday evening in April, at our apartment on East End Avenue. Just that afternoon Fred and I had found out that we loved each other, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Peggy!&#x201d; Weppler called sharply.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her eyes darted to him and back to Wolfe. &#x201c;Perhaps I should ask you, Mr. Wolfe. He thinks we should tell you just enough so you understand the problem, and I think you can&#x2019;t understand it unless we tell you everything. What do you think?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say until I hear it. Go ahead. If I have questions, we&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She nodded. &#x201c;I imagine you&#x2019;ll have plenty of questions. Have you ever been in love but would have died rather than let anyone see it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Never,&#x201d; Wolfe said emphatically. I kept my face straight.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, I was, and I admit it. But no one knew it, not even him. Did you, Fred?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I did not.&#x201d; Weppler was emphatic too.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Until that afternoon,&#x201d; Peggy told Wolfe. &#x201c;He was at the apartment for lunch, and it happened right after lunch. The others had left, and all of a sudden we were looking at each other, and then he spoke or I did, I don&#x2019;t know which.&#x201d; She looked at Weppler imploringly. &#x201c;I know you think this is embarrassing, Fred, but if he doesn&#x2019;t know what it was like he won&#x2019;t understand why you went upstairs to see Alberto.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Does he have to?&#x201d; Weppler demanded.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course he does.&#x201d; She returned to Wolfe. &#x201c;I suppose I can&#x2019;t make you see what it was like. We were completely&#x2014;well, we were in love, that&#x2019;s all, and I guess we had been for quite a while without saying it, and that made it all the more&#x2014;more overwhelming. Fred wanted to see my husband right away, to tell him about it and decide what we could do, and I said all right, so he went upstairs&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Upstairs?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s a duplex, and upstairs was my husband&#x2019;s soundproofed studio, where he practiced. So he went&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please, Peggy,&#x201d; Weppler interrupted her. His eyes went to Wolfe. &#x201c;You should have it firsthand. I went up to tell Mion that I loved his wife, and she loved me and not him, and to ask him to be civilized about it. Getting a divorce has come to be regarded as fairly civilized, but he didn&#x2019;t see it that way. He was anything but civilized. He wasn&#x2019;t violent, but he was damned mean. After some of that I got afraid I might do to him what Gif James had done, and I left. I didn&#x2019;t want to go back to Mrs. Mion while I was in that state of mind, so I left the studio by the door to the upper hall and took the elevator there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He stopped.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And?&#x201d; Wolfe prodded him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I walked it off. I walked across to the park, and after a while I had calmed down and I phoned Mrs. Mion, and she met me in the park. I told her what Mion&#x2019;s attitude was, and I asked her to leave him and come with me. She wouldn&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d; Weppler paused, and then went on, &#x201c;There are two complications you ought to have if you&#x2019;re to have everything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If they&#x2019;re relevant, yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re relevant all right. First, Mrs. Mion had and has money of her own. That was an added attraction for Mion. It wasn&#x2019;t for me. I&#x2019;m just telling you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you. And the second?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The second was Mrs. Mion&#x2019;s reason for not leaving Mion immediately. I suppose you know he had been the top tenor at the Met for five or six years, and his voice was gone&#x2014;temporarily. Gifford James, the baritone, had hit him on the neck with his fist and hurt his larynx&#x2014;that was early in March&#x2014;and Mion couldn&#x2019;t finish the season. It had been operated, but his voice hadn&#x2019;t come back, and naturally he was glum, and Mrs. Mion wouldn&#x2019;t leave him under those circumstances. I tried to persuade her to, but she wouldn&#x2019;t. I wasn&#x2019;t anything like normal that day, on account of what had happened to me for the first time in my life, and on account of what Mion had said to me, so I wasn&#x2019;t reasonable and I left her in the park and went downtown to a bar and started drinking. A lot of time went by and I had quite a few, but I wasn&#x2019;t pickled. Along toward seven o&#x2019;clock I decided I had to see her again and carry her off so she wouldn&#x2019;t spend another night there. That mood took me back to East End Avenue and up to the twelfth floor, and then I stood there in the hall a while, perhaps ten minutes, before my finger went to the pushbutton. Finally I rang, and the maid let me in and went for Mrs. Mion, but I had lost my nerve or something. All I did was suggest that we should have a talk with Mion together. She agreed, and we went upstairs and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Using the elevator?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, the stairs inside the apartment. We entered the studio. Mion was on the floor. We went over to him. There was a big hole through the top of his head. He was dead. I led Mrs. Mion out, made her come, and on the stairs&#x2014;they&#x2019;re too narrow to go two abreast&#x2014;she fell and rolled halfway down. I carried her to her room and put her on her bed, and I started for the living room, for the phone there, when I thought of something to do first. I went out and took the elevator to the ground floor, got the doorman and elevator man together, and asked them who had been taken up to the Mion apartment, either the twelfth floor or the thirteenth, that afternoon. I said they must be damn sure not to skip anybody. They gave me the names and I wrote them down. Then I went back up to the apartment and phoned the police. After I did that it struck me that a layman isn&#x2019;t supposed to decide if a man is dead, so I phoned Dr. Lloyd, who has an apartment there in the building. He came at once, and I took him up to the studio. We hadn&#x2019;t been there more than three or four minutes when the first policeman came, and of course&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you please,&#x201d; Wolfe put in crossly. &#x201c;Everything is sometimes too much. You haven&#x2019;t even hinted at the trouble you&#x2019;re in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Kilroys List, Volume One: 97 Monologues and Scenes by Female and Trans Playwrights</h2><p><p>"The superheroines of the theater are back&#x2014;and better and bolder than ever."&#x2014; <i>Backstage</i></p><p>"These plays have been developed and vetted for artistic excellence; they just happen to possess the added bonus of representing a voice that's currently being underproduced.

Roger Hallam has answers. In <em>Common Sense for the 21st Century</em>, Roger Hallam, cofounder of Extinction Rebellion, outlines how movements around the world need to come together <em>now</em> to start doing what works: engaging in mass civil disobedience to make real change happen. The book gives people the tools to understand not only why mass disruption, mass arrests, and mass sacrifice are necessary but also details how to carry out acts of civil disobedience effectively, respectfully and nonviolently. It bypasses contemporary political theory, and instead is inspired by Thomas Paine, the pragmatic 18th-century revolutionary whose pamphlet <em>Common Sense </em>sparked the American Revolution. <em>Common Sense for the 21st Century </em>urges us to confront the truth about climate change and argues forcefully that only a revolution of society and the state, similar to the turn that Paine urged the Americans to take into the political unknown, can save us now.</p></p><p><p>In April 2018, Roger Hallam met with a group of 15 activists, environmentalists, and scientists in a caf� in Bristol. Along with Gail Bradbrook and Simon Bramwell, he and others founded Extinction Rebellion. A former organic farmer and long-time climate change activist, Hallam has been on successful hunger strikes, been arrested 10 times and has served a prison term, all in the service of preventing a climate catastrophe.</p><p>&#x201c;There is only one question: How do we stop climate change? In this tough-minded and uncompromising book, Roger Hallam gives the answer so many politicians and business people don&#x2019;t want to hear. <em>Common Sense</em> <em>for the 21st Century</em> is not just an argument; it&#x2019;s an instruction manual for ripping through the complacency and corruption that will destroy our planet.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Paul Mason, author of <em>Why It&#x2019;s Kicking Off Everywhere</em> and <em>Postcapitalism</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Is <em>Common Sense for the 21st Century</em> the best hope we&#x2019;ve got to prevent human extinction?

This has significantly affected the economic wellbeing of the country&#x2019;s most vulnerable populations. In Home Economics: The Consequences of Changing Family Structure, Nick Schulz argues that serious consideration of the consequences of changing family structure is sorely missing from conversations about American economic policy and politics. Apprehending a complete picture of this country&#x2019;s economic condition will be impossible if poverty, income inequality, wealth disparities, and unemployment alone are taken into consideration, claims Schulz. <br><br>This book will trace how family structure has transformed over the last half century, ruminate on the causes of those changes, consider what conclusions can be drawn about the economic consequences of the changes in family, and offer ideas for how to handle the issue in the years to come.</p><p>Nick Schulz was the DeWitt Wallace Fellow at AEI and editor-in-chief of American.com, AEI&#39;s online magazine focusing on business, economics, and public affairs.

In <i>Chicano and Chicana Art</i>&#x2014;which includes many of Chicano/a art's landmark and foundational texts and manifestos&#x2014;artists, curators, and cultural critics trace the development of Chicano/a art from its early role in the Chicano civil rights movement to its mainstream acceptance in American art institutions. Throughout this teaching-oriented volume they address a number of themes, including the politics of border life, public art practices such as posters and murals, and feminist and queer artists' figurations of Chicano/a bodies. They also chart the multiple cultural and artistic influences&#x2014;from American graffiti and Mexican pre-Columbian spirituality to pop art and modernism&#x2014;that have informed Chicano/a art's practice.<br><br> Contributors.

It explores the nation&#x2019;s evolving economic, social, and political landscape by examining how different types of enterprising activities rose and fell, how new labor and production technologies supplanted old ones&#x2014;and at what costs&#x2014;and how Americans of all stripes responded to the tumultuous world of business. In particular, historian Benjamin Waterhouse highlights the changes in business practices, the development of different industries and sectors, and the complex relationship between business and national politics.<br> <br>From executives and bankers to farmers and sailors, from union leaders to politicians to slaves, business history <i>is </i>American history, and Waterhouse pays tribute to the unnamed millions who traded their labor (sometimes by choice, often not) or decided what products to consume (sometimes informed, often not). Their story includes those who fought against what they saw as an oppressive system of exploitation as well as those who defended free markets from any outside intervention. <i>The Land of Enterprise</i> is not only a comprehensive look into our past achievements, but offers clues as to how to confront the challenges of today&#x2019;s world: globalization, income inequality, and technological change.</p><p>Benjamin C. Waterhouse is a historian of American politics, business, and capitalism. Waterhouse graduated from Princeton University and received his PhD in history from Harvard University.

Within a few decades, those rulers sent thousands of soldiers, miners, farmers, and others to bring back precious metals, furs, timber, human slaves, and other goods.<br> <br>We also know that, between 1500 and 1750, the center of economic power in Europe shifted from the southern parts of the continent&#x2014;Italy, Spain, and Portugal&#x2014;to a small island in the North Atlantic comprising England, Scotland, and Wales. The kingdom known as Great Britain after 1707 emerged in that early modern period as a dominant sea power, an imperial colonizer, a global trader, and the leader in factory-based manufacturing. And then in 1776, a major part of Britain&#x2019;s colonial empire seceded, fought a long global war, and achieved political independence.<br> <br>The economic relationship that Anglo-Americans cultivated with Britain during the colonial period proved pivotal. As part of the British empire, white colonial Americans participated in a vibrant, trade-oriented economic system rooted in the exploitation of natural resources and the creation of increasingly sophisticated business forms. After independence, the future of that economic landscape appeared uncertain, and vital debates unfolded about what type of economy the new country should pursue&#x2014;one devoted to export-based agriculture, or one that built on the new manufacturing technologies that Britain had pioneered in the second half of the 18th century? As American politicians sat down to write the Constitution in 1787, these questions created powerful rifts as competing factions argued&#x2014;with far-reaching consequences&#x2014;over the future of business and the legacy of the colonial economy.<br> The World Economy, c. 1500<p></p> <br>To grasp the economic challenges that the first generation of Americans faced when the United States achieved political independence, it is helpful to take the long view of business practices during the period of European colonization. As the major powers of Europe spread their navies and peoples across Africa and the Americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, economic life came increasingly to revolve around transatlantic trade.<br> <br>By 1500, intercontinental land-based commerce had flourished across the Eurasian landmass for several hundred years. The expansion of the Arab empire across the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the Moghul Empire in the Indian subcontinent, connected China, India, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. Powerful rulers across that vast geography secured trade routes and reaped significant wealth from the labor of agrarian people. Fabrics&#x2014;silk from the East; wool from colder climates&#x2014;as well as spices, wood, and precious metals all traveled tremendous distances.1<br> <br>Further south, traders from the Arab and Ottoman empires did a brisk overland business with their counterparts in West African kingdoms across the Sahara. In the mid-15th century, seafaring Europeans, particularly from Portugal, began to arrive regularly by ship along the West African coast to trade textiles for goods such as ivory, sugar, and gold. And by the end of that century, such trade regularly included slaves. Portuguese and later Spanish and other European traders purchased captured Africans to work first on sugar plantations they established on the Canary Islands and later, by the first decades of the 16th century, in the Caribbean and South and North America.2<br> <br>Before the 1500s, people in the Americas lay outside these trade networks. The indigenous population of the American continents included vast empires such as the Aztec in present-day Mexico, major city-states such as Cahokia near present-day St. Louis, Missouri, and smaller societies of more mobile and less agriculturally rooted people, particularly near the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and South America. Trade was extensive within and between the Americas before 1500, but the continents were cut off from the rest of the world. As most students of history know, that situation changed with the advent of European transatlantic voyages in the 1490s, with devastating consequences. In the next three hundred years, a combination of disease, war, and genocide at the hands of European conquerors decimated the native populations of the Caribbean, destroyed empires such as the Incas in Peru, and dramatically affected the number of indigenous people of the eastern woodlands of North America, pushing many inland away from the coast. By the late 16th century, entrepreneurial English businesspeople looked to those &#x201c;abandoned&#x201d; wooded areas along the Atlantic as promising sites for colonies.3<br> <br>The most significant change to the world economy, therefore, was the ascent of European seafaring merchants whose newfound prowess in shipbuilding and navigation allowed them to reach parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas in greater numbers, and to profit immensely in the process. These new trade ventures changed the distribution and settlement patterns of people around the world. But just as important for the development of business and modern capitalism, the &#x201c;Age of Exploration&#x201d; (as the textbooks somewhat cheerfully call this period) also marked a monumental reorganization of the European economy.<br> <br>Historians have traditionally tried to capture the changes in European social, political, and economic life that developed around 1500 in response to increased global trade by suggesting a transition between the earlier &#x201c;medieval&#x201d; period and the subsequent &#x201c;modern&#x201d; (or &#x201c;early modern,&#x201d; to be more precise) period.4 Essentially, what happened was a change from a feudal model of economic organization to a mercantilist model, the forerunner to a capitalist system.<br> <br>As with everything in history, this shift was far more complicated than such a simple claim would suggest. Many people quibble over these terms, since the period of so-called feudalism included such diverse experiences over time and space. Ditto for mercantilism, modern, and, for that matter, capitalism. After all, history is a long-running, continuous process, and human beings never jump from one way of living to a different one overnight. So suggesting a clean break from a &#x201c;feudal&#x201d; past to a &#x201c;capitalist&#x201d; present does injustice to truth. However, if we&#x2019;re taking a long view and accept these concepts as generalities, not rigidly defined systems, this division provides a helpful way of characterizing important changes.<br> <br>When historians use the term feudalism, they are attempting to describe an economic system in which power relations among people formed the building blocks of society. In a classically feudal model (not to be confused with reality), most people worked as farmers (the peasants), giving over their agricultural product to a local ruler (the lord) in exchange for military security. Political power flowed from the strength of these personal connections. The concepts of private property and individual rights did not factor into these arrangements, and most people&#x2019;s socioeconomic status was fixed at birth. Wealth was tied up in the control over land and agricultural production. Trade existed, but not on a massive scale, and most of the agricultural yield was consumed locally.<br> <br>Even within an archetypal feudal society, not everyone lived this way. Off the feudal manors, artisanal craftspeople populated small towns and produced tools, equipment, and clothing for the agricultural system. Artisans typically conducted such manufacturing out of the home and adhered to a strict labor hierarchy: Masters taught their skills to apprentices, who hoped to one day move up to the master level. Guilds&#x2014;organizations of skilled craftspeople&#x2014;regulated the number of up-and-coming apprentices to keep competition low and prices stable.<br> <br>Another key group in medieval towns was the merchants, who exchanged the surplus production from both the farmers and the craftspeople for foreign-made goods. In places such as Italy, traders accumulated significant wealth and many turned into bankers, making their living by guarding other people&#x2019;s money and lending it out, at a price.<br> <br>These town-dwellers&#x2014;manufacturers, shopkeepers, bankers, and traders&#x2014;constituted an important minority in feudal society. Known as &#x201c;burghers,&#x201d; from the Latin word for a fortified dwelling, they constituted a social class distinct from either the landless peasants or the land-owning feudal rulers. When Europe&#x2019;s dominant economic paradigm shifted toward capitalism, they became the core of the bourgeoisie, the property-owning middle class.<br> <br>Europe transitioned away from feudalism in the 15th and 16th centuries. Monarchs in Spain, France, and England grew wealthier through trade, which spread from the Mediterranean to coastal West Africa, and then to the Americas. In the process, they consolidated military power at the expense of local lords. A new economic philosophy that historians call mercantilism gradually took hold, reflecting the conviction that economic activity should bolster the wealth and power of nations. Western European monarchs in particular found new ways to expand, promote, and protect trade, reaping both profits and the political power that came with it. This decidedly unfeudal attitude toward external trade led European powers to business opportunities emerging in the New World.5<br> The Business of Conquest<p></p> <br>The renowned historian Carl Degler famously wrote about America that &#x201c;capitalism came in the first ships.&#x201d;6 His point was that the European conquest of the New World coincided historically with the profound economic changes that produced a recognizably new system that we call capitalism, but the story was quite a bit more complicated, of course. Capitalism did not emerge as a coherent system. It has never achieved that status. As a system of economic organization, capitalism has taken on many forms across time, and exists in a variety of manifestations even today. But even though &#x201c;capitalism&#x201d; defies a simple definition, Degler&#x2019;s notion still stands that major changes in economic organization and business opportunities accompanied the European colonization of the Americas, beginning around the year 1500.<br> <br>Europeans&#x2019; exploration, exploitation, and ultimate inhabitation of the New World was at heart a financial undertaking, enacted in the mercantilist spirit of profit-making for the realm. Just as important as its causes were its consequences: The act of setting up colonies&#x2014;with all the bloodshed, atrocity, and hardship it entailed for native people&#x2014;had long-range consequences for the way European and colonial economies operated. From gold and silver mines in New Spain to fur trapping by the French in present-day Canada to massive sugar, indigo, tobacco, and eventually cotton plantations, European colonizers used the Americas to create new wealth, new types of business, and new ways of thinking about property, profit, and enterprise.<br> <br>For students of American history, it&#x2019;s an old story: ships funded by the Spanish and Portuguese governments began to journey regularly to the Caribbean and South America starting in the 1490s in search of material riches. And, in general, they found them. During the 16th century, Iberian soldiers and merchants traded and stole untold quantities of precious metals, kidnapped natives for sale into slavery in Europe, and established permanent settlements&#x2014;frequently after waging genocidal war on local inhabitants&#x2014;to facilitate this exploitation.7<br> <br>Those initial conquests followed a traditional economic model: Generate wealth by accumulating valuable stuff. At the same time, these mercantilist exploits brought a major economic downside. The huge amounts of silver shipped back to Spain flooded the currency market, sparking a bout of inflation that lasted a century and crippled the Spanish economy. In spite of its large land-holdings in the Americas, Spain would never recover the economic power it wielded in the early 16th century.8<br> <br>By the mid-1500s, a second wave of European voyages to the New World brought merchants from France and England who had motives and strategies similar to those of their Iberian counterparts. With the powerful Spanish and Portuguese empires laying physical claim to lands to the south, early French and English explorers headed north. Given France&#x2019;s superior military and economic position, the French crown began to fund fur-trading outposts along the St. Lawrence River in present-day Quebec.9<br> <br>England, poorer than the major continental kingdoms, showed less interest in establishing Atlantic trading routes until later in the 16th century, by which time political and economic power had shifted away from Spain and Portugal. In the 1570s and 1580s, Queen Elizabeth authorized and underwrote imperial operations first in Ireland and then across the North Atlantic in Nova Scotia, urging explorers to claim lands for the crown and search for precious metals.10 While the quest for riches proved disappointing, these ventures led to permanent colonial establishments. Over the course of the next hundred years, several hundred thousand English people migrated to the New World. Most of those early migrants lived along the Atlantic coast in former Indian towns that had been abandoned during the plague epidemic that forced survivors inland from the coast in the late 16th century.11<br> <br>From the outset, the English colonization of North America was driven by economic imperatives. Although Americans often remember the religious motivations behind that process&#x2014;stressing the story of the Puritans in Massachusetts, for example&#x2014;business opportunities and economic institutions played just as important a role. Just as explorers sailing for Queen Elizabeth had scouted the continent for hidden riches, so, too, did English colonists create more durable communities in the 17th century as part of a larger, transatlantic business venture. In fact, the first two successful English colonies in what would become the United States&#x2014;Virginia (1607) and Massachusetts Bay (1620)&#x2014;were themselves private companies.12 More specifically, each was chartered in the style of a joint-stock company, an early-modern legal entity that grew increasingly important to the global economy during the height of Europe&#x2019;s colonial expansion.<br> <br>Joint-stock companies, the forerunners of today&#x2019;s publicly owned corporations, pooled private sources of capital under the official protection of the crown, funding ventures that were too expensive or risky for an individual person. Drawing on a system of legal contracts developed in Italy centuries earlier, 16th-century English monarchs pioneered the practice of issuing corporate charters that granted an exclusive right to trade in a certain area to a particular group of subjects. In addition to creating a helpful monopoly, these charters created legal entities whose ownership was spread among several inves...</p><h2>Any Friend of God&#39;s Is a Friend of Mine: A Biblical and Historical Explanation of the Catholic Doctrine of the Communion of Saints</h2><p>The best ever explanation of the Catholic doctrine of the communion of saints written for a popular audience.

He remembered that Jenks had expressed interest in the practice several times. Evidently, Matt's explanation that they did it because dawn was a dangerous time of day when enemy ships&#x2014;and in their "old" war, submarines in particular&#x2014;might see their silhouette before they saw the enemy, had made eminent sense to the Imperial commodore. It looked like Jenks was beginning to institute the practice among all the ships of his command. That was certainly for the good&#x2014;if they all became true allies someday. Matt realized, however, that he might have given away a serious advantage if the Empire and Alliance ever found themselves on opposite sides. Oh, well, it couldn't be helped. Right now, they had the same cause and they needed their friends to be prepared</p><p>That morning, instead of standing down into a morning routine, Matt gave the order to "make all preparations for getting underway." Sparks began to rise from nearby stacks, and black and gray smoke curled into the air as <i>Walker</i> and the "squadron," consisting of <i>Achilles</i>, <i>Icarus</i>, and <i>Ulysses</i>, raised steam and prepared to pull their hooks. Their immediate destination was an old Imperial outpost&#x2014;probably the first. Jenks said the island, called Respite, was the first hospitable place his ancestors had encountered on their voyage to the East, and it was there they'd rested, victualed, and taken on fresh water before continuing in search of the most remote place they could find. Some few had stayed, tired of the seemingly endless journey, and Respite had been almost constantly inhabited ever since. Over time, it became the regional capital of all the surrounding islands and until recently, the western frontier of the Empire. It had been to one of the newer, slightly more northwestern outposts under Respite's jurisdiction that Rebecca's one-armed protector, Sean O'Casey, had been fleeing the Imperial hangman after an unsuccessful rebellion against Company usurpation of Imperial authority. It had been only wild coincidence that Princess Rebecca Anne McDonald had been dispatched aboard the same doomed ship by her father, the Governor-Emperor himself. In his effort to provide for her safety from increasingly dark Company machinations, he'd set the wheels in motion that left her marooned and presumed dead these two long years. In the end, the Company had snatched her anyway.</p><p>The best thing, from the perspectives of Matt and Jenks, was that Respite's inhabitants had become increasingly dissatisfied with the arbitrary policies enacted by the distant Imperial government&#x2014;particularly as the Courts of Directors and Proprietors fell increasingly into the hands of the Company. The "Respitans" had always been a self-sufficient, individualistic lot, and Jenks suspected they would have supported O'Casey's rebellion if they'd caught wind of it in time. He was sure that when USS <i>Walker</i> and her consorts arrived with news of the fight that <i>Walker</i> and <i>Achilles</i> had had with Company and pressed Imperial warships bent on murdering the princess, they would find themselves among a sympathetic population and territorial governor. A perfect place for the Allied supply ships and tankers to head for.</p><p><i>Icarus</i> flew her Imperial flag once more, and Matt noticed with interest that <i>Ulysses</i>' new Imperial flag flew above her old Company flag. He wondered what the next Company ship or official they encountered would think of that. Bosun's pipes twittered similar or familiar calls on every ship, and the special sea and anchor detail on <i>Walker</i>'s fo'c'sle sprayed the anchor chain with hoses as the steam capstan sent it dripping and clattering into the locker below. Finally, the anchor was aweigh and the little crane forward hoisted it into its cut-out storage space forward. Matt watched while the other ships' anchors were raised and secured, and was struck by how primitive his own ship was in many ways. The stocks on Imperial anchors were wood and <i>Walker</i>'s was iron, but the overall shape was virtually identical. His ship was probably the last class in the U.S. Navy to use the old-style anchors, a design completely unchanged for a hundred years, but the Imperial model was even older.</p><p>He shook his head and strode from the bridgewing to the chart table. No one aboard was really sure where they were headed anymore. Somewhere in what they remembered as the Carolines, he supposed. It seemed the farther east they steamed, the less relevant their charts of the "old world" became. Courtney Bradford took the disparity between their charts and the actual locations of the various islands of the "Eastern Sea" as a matter of course. He still insisted that the larger, exposed surface area of the atolls was consistent with his Ice Age theory, and Matt had to agree there might be something to that. The fact that, according to the charts Jenks had loaned them, <i>these</i> Carolines were larger and more substantial than Matt remembered, or the old charts indicated, seemed to follow. What didn't make any sense to Matt and many others was why the atolls, or actual islands, had been so shifted around. They'd discovered quite a few islands in&#x2014;call them the Marshalls for lack of anything better&#x2014;where there shouldn't be anything at all. The island where they'd made their emergency repairs was one example. According to Jenks's charts, other substantial atolls such as Kwajalein didn't even exist. Bradford maintained that it was all perfectly understandable. Matt only wished Courtney would find some way to make it just as easily explainable. In the meantime, and for the foreseeable future, he would have to trust Imperial charts of the region.</p><p>"All ahead one-third," Matt said. "Make your course one, one, five."</p><p>"Ahead one-third," Staas-Fin, or "Finny," replied. "One, one, five, ay!" The blower rumbled contentedly and <i>Walker</i> gathered way. Juan arrived with his battered carafe and a tray of cups and Matt accepted one with thanks. Juan's coffee was terrible, even using the ersatz beans of this world, but it was coffee of a sort and that's all that matters sometimes.</p><p>"Thanks, Juan," Captain Reddy murmured as he brought the green foam-rimmed brew to his lips.</p><p>"My pleasure, Cap-tan! Would you like breakfast? A haircut perhaps? A hot towel and a shave would do wonders for you," he hinted. Matt's razor had about given up the ghost, and he'd finally relented and begun growing a beard like the rest of the men under his command. "I traded a case of rusty cans of 'scum weenies' for a new Imperial razor!" he declared in triumph. "It is quite sharp!"</p><p>Matt scratched his itchy chin and winced. He'd love a shave&#x2014;but he had never let Juan shave him despite the Filipino's incessant attempts. Now... he had the only razor. Matt was convinced that if he ever relented, Juan would be shaving him for the rest of his life. On the other hand, he'd always believed that keeping himself well-groomed was important. It was just his little way of showing defiance in the face of the odds against them. "No matter how bad it gets, the Skipper always shaves." Something like that.</p><p>He sighed. "Well, can we do it right here? I mean, can I just sit here in my chair?"</p><p>Juan beamed. "Of course, Cap-tan! In fact, it would be best, I believe. The chair is just the right height! I will return in a moment!" With that, Juan darted away and Matt looked around the bridge. Finny was trying to suppress a grin and the lookouts diligently studied the horizon. Norman Kutas glanced at the chart and stepped around the chart house&#x2014;probably so Matt wouldn't see him crack up. True to his word, Juan returned quickly. He had two 'Cat mess attendants in tow, one with a basin of hot water, the other holding some damp, steaming towels. Juan immediately removed Matt's hat and draped a towel over his face.</p><p>"Oh, for God's sake, Juan! I thought you were just going to shave me!" he muttered under the towel. "I can't conn the ship like this!"</p><p>The shipwide comm suddenly blared. "Now hear this!" It was Chief Bosun's Mate Fitzhugh Gray's voice. He was in on it too! Gray was around sixty, barely shorter than his captain, but the man who'd once grown flabby and jaded on the China station of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet had transformed into a lean, powerful pillar of moral authority within the Alliance. He was no longer a "mere" chief bosun's mate; there were plenty of those in the rapidly expanding American Navy. He'd become something much more, still ill-defined. Officially, he commanded Matt's personal security detail, the "Captain's Guard," and was "chief armsman of the supreme Allied Commander." Unofficially, he was often referred to as "The S.B." (Super Bosun), but most, even Chief Bosun's Mate Bashear, still just called him "the Bosun." To Matt, and probably Matt alone, he was still just "Boats."</p><p>"Now hear this!" Gray repeated. "Lieutenant Steele to the bridge! The exec will take the conn while the captain endures his mornin' toy-letty!" A roar of laughter echoed through the ship, amid the stamping of Lemurian feet.</p><p>"Oh my God, Boats!" Matt groaned, but he couldn't help laughing. "Put yourself on report! And... whoever else is responsible for this stunt!"</p><p>"Aye, aye, Skipper," Gray said, "but beggin' the Skipper's pardon, your beard is startin' to look a little scruffy." He lowered his voice. "That, and with all the stuff that's been goin' on, the fight, the chase for the girls... me and a few of the fellas figured you could use a laugh. Besides, you've always stayed shaved through a lot worse scrapes than this. Don't want the fellas to think you're lettin' yourself go."</p><p>For just an instant Matt tensed. Gray couldn't see his face under the towel, but it might actually be best. Suddenly, Matt reached out and grabbed Gray's sleeve, pulling him down closer.</p><p>"They don't call you Super Bosun for nothing, do they?" Matt whispered huskily. "You're right. I need a laugh, and so does this crew. Let's make the most of it."</p><p>Freshly shaved, trimmed, and with his face tingling with whatever refreshing soap Juan had been able to create or procure, Matt sheepishly relieved a grinning Steele and resumed his watch. Cheerful voices and snatches of good-natured banter rose to his ears from the fo'c'sle forward, and the weather deck aft. It suddenly struck him that his crew was happy&#x2014;not because they'd pulled a stunt on the Skipper, but because they'd managed to do something for him. He felt embarrassed and a little ashamed that he hadn't noticed a growing cheerfulness aboard the ship. He'd been too lost in his own duty, and his ongoing misery over Sandra's unknown fate. The rescue of the princess might be the primary diplomatic reason for the mission, but to him it was personal. He had to have Sandra back, for the very survival of his soul. He needed to rescue the young princess too. She'd trusted him, relied on him to keep her safe, and he loved her too, he supposed, much like a daughter. His recent mood must have been a terrible drag on the ship.</p><p>All the crew felt his anger and they'd do whatever was necessary to make things right, but these were extraordinary times as well. The humans under his command were almost giddy with the prospect that they were nearing lands where actual human <i>women</i> dwelt, and each of them harbored happy fantasies of how they'd ultimately break the "dame famine" that had plagued them ever since the Squall. The 'Cats were happy too. They'd steamed much farther into the vast Eastern Sea than they'd ever believed possible. They'd always known the world was round, but they also <i>knew</i> that the force humans referred to as "gravity" pulled down. It had simply followed that if one went too far from the "top" of the world, one would plummet off the side into the endless heavens. They'd <i>believed</i> the human Americans, <i>hoped</i> they were right that gravity pulled down wherever on the world one stood, but only now had it become a demonstrated fact. Matt knew this "fact" flew in the face of some very long-held religious dogma, and regretted that they'd upset their friends yet again in that respect, but the contradiction didn't seem that important to his Lemurian-American crew right now. Just the fact that they hadn't fallen off the world and were free to continue their important adventure satisfied them at present. Later, they might contemplate the religious implications. Matt knew from the messages relayed through Manila from Baalkpan that Adar already was, but right now, <i>Walker</i> was a happy ship and his own serious, intense mood had been like a... wet towel on the humor of the crew. He would have to try harder to conceal his anxiety and concern. He'd had a lot of practice at that&#x2014;but then, of course, he'd always had Sandra to help him.</p><p>He glanced at his watch. Almost 0800 and time for the watch change, so this was as good a time as any. "Mr. Campeti," he said, addressing <i>Walker</i>'s new gunnery officer, "I assume you've managed to standardize the drill on the number four gun?" The number four was a dual purpose, 4.7-inch gun they'd salvaged from <i>Amagi</i> to replace the 4"-50 that had been badly damaged in the Battle of Baalkpan. The respectable quantity of ammunition for it that they'd salvaged as well was still high-explosive, cordite propelled, as opposed to the black powder-loaded four-inch-fifty's they had for the other guns. Until they perfected their own cordite using the indigenous materials, they couldn't "regulate" the 4.7-inch with the others, and they'd decided to keep it in local control.</p><p>"Aye, aye, sir. The drill's mostly the same, and the fellows have it down pat."</p><p>"Very well. They no longer have any excuse to be late, then, I take it?"</p><p>"No, sir."</p><p>"Good." Matt grinned. "With all this 'nervous energy' everyone seems to have today, we should be able to break some records!" He turned to the bridge talker. "Sound general quarters, if you please. The watch is ticking!"</p><p>The "drowning goose" began gasping for air, and Sonny Campeti raced up the ladder beside the chart house, to the fire control platform above. Other men and 'Cats quickly appeared, laden with belts of ammunition and shoving two heavy Browning .30-calibers up the ladder to waiting hands.</p><p>The Bosun paced the fo'c'sle, bellowing at the crew of the number one gun in his inimitable fashion, while Chief Gunner's Mate Paul Stites assembled his gun's crews atop the amidships gun platform.</p><p>Ensign Fred Reynolds and his copilot/observer Kari-Faask dumped their breakfast in the can under the amidships deckhouse, despite Earl Lanier's ranting, and raced toward where their Nancy's "deck crew" was clearing and securing its cover, and preparing the hoist davit that would put the plane down in the water alongside. The same "deck crew" would also serve as a "plane dump detail" if the aircraft was ever damaged in action or became a deck hazard in any way.</p><p>Chack's Marine drummer sounded a long roll, and the Marines not assigned to gun's crews abandoned their ordinary sea...</p></p><h2>Pattern Behavior: The Seamy Side of Fashion</h2><p><strong>For those who like their humor droll, deadpan, and hysterically funny, <em>Pattern Behavior</em> features more than 100 vintage McCall's patterns--with captions that will leave you in stitches</strong>. <br><br>Feeling nostalgic for your grandmother's old sewing patterns?

She is Associate Professor and Walker Percy Fellow in Poetry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and an editor-at-large for the Los Angeles Review of Books.&#x201c;Calvocoressi&nbsp;resists the limitations of language&#x2015;especially where gender is concerned&#x2015;to more fully capture the experience of a self &#x201c;unlimited in its possibilities.&#x201d; The setting of her third collection is woodsy, nocturnal, and by turns sinister and merciful; where &#x201c;it did get dark&#x201d; enough to see the stars &#x201c;but how bright it was.&#x201d; A range of characters compose a makeshift cast&#x2015;or family&#x2015;fluid enough to include a hermit, a cowboy, and a dowager. These poems balance wildness and control in a fearless treatment of eros, identity, trauma, and all that resists easy categorization. The voice encompasses the colloquial as well as the high lyrical: &#x201c;Oak leaves so full of late summer// sun even I thought,&nbsp;Obscene, and stood stunned/ for a moment.&#x201d; When particular forms aren&#x2019;t up to the task of rendering something with tender and unflinching attentiveness, Calvocoressi reaches outside of poetry altogether: &#x201c;Oh.

There&#x2019;s a sense that the speaker wants to return to an earlier time, too, a throwback feel to the pastoral scenes she sets and a need to shuck convention. The speaker and the Bandleader meet in a series of poems strung throughout this thought-provoking collection, and the use of the Dal Segno immediately strips away expectation, making the focus on the acts of looking and touching rather than body parts interacting conventionally. &nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A vertiginous, wondering, painful, uncannily and deeply sexy book:&nbsp;<em>Rocket Fantastic</em>&nbsp;offers an arresting array of characters, escapees from the loneliest country song and swivellers to a wild jazz.

It is as if we have entered the green wood of traditional balladry- that charged, liminal space of encounter- without ever leaving a late twentieth/early twenty-first century America of war, debt, precarity, barbecues, radios, and guns.

The histories of Mexico and the United States have been intertwined since the 18th century, when both were colonies of European empires. America&#x2019;s fascination with Mexican culture emerged in the 19th century and continues to this day. In turn, Mexico looked to the U.S. as a model of modernity, its highways and high-rises emblematic of "The American Way of Life." Exploring the design movements that defined both places during the 20th century, this book is arranged into four sections&#x2014; Spanish Colonial inspiration, Pre-Hispanic Revivals, Folk Art and Craft Traditions, and Modernism. Featured are essays by leading scholars and illustrations of more than 300 works by architects and designers including Richard Neutra, Luis Barrag�n, Charles and Ray Eames, and Clara Porset. The word translation originally meant "to bring or carry across." The constant migration between California and Mexico has produced cultures of great richness and complexity, while the transfers of people and materials that began with centuries-old trade routes continue to resonate in modern society, creating synergies that are "found in translation."</p><p>Wendy Kaplan is Department Head and Curator of Decorative Arts and Design at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art."<i>Design in California and Mexico, 1915-1985</i> edited by Wendy Kaplan, is a catalog of beautiful man-made things &#x2013; out-side the fine arts &#x2013; produced in our most populous state and neighboring country during the heart of the previous century.

Ceramics, furniture and textiles are likewise varied and stunning." -<i>The Wall Street Journal<br><br></i>"In this truly inspired book (which is tied to an ongoing exhibition at LACMA) the deep but too often overlooked connections between Mexico and California in the 20th century are given their due."-<i>The&nbsp;Daily Beast</i></p><h2>The Veterinarians&#39; Guide to Your Cat&#39;s Symptoms</h2><p>The experts reveal how to interpret and understand your cat's symptoms <br>and what steps to take to ensure its health.<br><br>This comprehensive and practical book is designed to assist cat owners in understanding their pets' bodies and health based on signs and symptoms of disease, and in determining the most common medical problems that might cause particular symptoms. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adopting the "decision chart" format from popular symptom guides for human ailments, such as the American Medical Association's Guide to Your Family's Symptoms and Take Care of Yourself, five leading veterinarians have designed a user-friendly chart system that will guide a pet owner from noting the symptom and observing the cat's behavior to understanding the associated signs of an illness, the possible conditions, and the best steps to take. Filled with more than 150 charts in an easy-to-follow two-color format and medical drawings, The Veterinarians' Guide to Your Cat's Symptoms is the indispensable reference for cat owners. It not only considers the problems of sick and injured pets, but also addresses the needs of healthy animals.

For one thing, people use words to tell you what hurts and when it started. And for another thing, we, as fellow people, have a little insight into what's healthy human behavior and what isn't. When the toddler cries and then vomits lunch, we sense something's not right, even if the child can't verbalize the problem. But when your cat brings up a hairball, does that mean she is ill? When your cat meows, it's hard to know if it means "Hey, pet me," or "I feel rotten."<p> To know when cats are acting oddly, you need to know what normal is. <i>The Veterinarians' Guide to Your Cat's Symptoms</i> starts off describing a healthy cat body, from skin, hair, eyes, ears, and teeth to the inner workings of the cardiovascular, digestive, urinary, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems. This picture of feline health is followed by a chapter on how to keep those systems healthy, with advice on choosing a veterinarian, plus vaccinations, spaying and neutering, nutrition, and litter boxes.</p><p> Part 2 does an excellent job of covering accidents, medical emergencies, and diseases that could threaten your cat. This section discusses broken bones, burns, and poisoning; conditions such as hypoglycemia, pneumonia, seizures, and pyometra; as well as infectious and parasitic diseases. For each, it tells you what to look for in your cat and when to dash off to the veterinary hospital for emergency treatment. There's a chapter on feline first aid, as well.</p><p> And if you suspect your kitty isn't up to snuff but aren't sure? Part 3 is where you can ensure that your cat's behavior is normal, with more than 130 common feline symptoms and flow charts explaining how to interpret them. Associated signs, possible conditions, and recommended actions are listed for each symptom. Perhaps your cat is showing signs of depressed appetite, with difficulty breathing and possibly coughing as well. These could be signs of cardiac disease, pneumonia, or even lung cancer, and a trip to the emergency clinic for x-rays is strongly suggested. On the other hand, maybe your cat is eating wool. The chart says this condition (termed <i>Wool Eater</i>, a form of compulsive behavior) is not unusual for Siamese cats, but could lead to vomiting or intestinal obstruction; the recommended action is to put the wool out of kitty's reach, and maybe see a veterinarian for behavior-modification medication.

Make learning more meaningful by teaching the "whole game"</b> <p>David Perkins, a noted authority on teaching and learning and co-director of Harvard's Project Zero, introduces a practical and research-based framework for teaching. He describes how teaching any subject at any level can be made more effective if students are introduced to the "whole game," rather than isolated pieces of a discipline. Perkins explains how learning academic subjects should be approached like learning baseball or any game, and he demonstrates this with seven principles for making learning whole: from making the game worth playing (emphasizing the importance of motivation to sustained learning), to working on the hard parts (the importance of thoughtful practice), to learning how to learn (developing self-managed learners).</p> <ul> <li>Vividly explains how to organize learning in ways that allow people to do important things with what they know</li> <li>Offers guidelines for transforming education to prepare our youth for success in a rapidly changing world</li> <li>Filled with real-world, illustrative examples of the seven principles</li> </ul> <p>At the end of each chapter, Perkins includes "Wonders of Learning," a summary of the key ideas.</p></p><p><p>Making Learning Whole</p> <p>"One summer I participated in Little League baseball . . . Baseball for me was a triumph of mediocrity. I wasn't especially good at it but I wasn't awful either . . . In the years since those days I've come to an odd conclusion about those early learning experiences: The results were only so-so but the process was pretty good . . . It was pretty good because from the beginning I built up a feel for the whole game. I knew what hitting the ball or missing the ball got you. I knew about scoring runs and keeping score.

This is the shocking yet fascinating message of <em>At Our Wits' End</em>. The authors take us on a journey through the growing body of evidence that we are significantly less intelligent now than we were a hundred years ago. The research proving this is, at once, profoundly thought-provoking, highly controversial, and it&#x2019;s currently only read by academics. But the authors are passionate that it cannot remain ensconced in the ivory tower any longer. With <em>At Our Wits&#x2019; End</em>, they present the first ever popular scientific book on this crucially important issue. They prove that intelligence &#x2015; which is strongly genetic &#x2015; was increasing up until the breakthrough of the Industrial Revolution, because we were subject to the rigors of Darwinian Selection, meaning that lots of surviving children was the preserve of the cleverest. But since then, they show, intelligence has gone into rapid decline, because large families are increasingly the preserve of the least intelligent. The book explores how this change has occurred and, crucially, what its consequences will be for the future. Can we find a way of reversing the decline of our IQ? Or will we witness the collapse of civilization and the rise of a new Dark Age?</p></p><p><p>Edward Dutton has a degree in Theology from Durham University and a PhD in Religious Studies from Aberdeen University.

It conjures up a hazy image of a caravan of camels laden with silk on a dusty desert track, reaching from China to Rome. The reality was different--and far more interesting. In <em>The Silk Road: A New History with Documents</em>, Valerie Hansen describes the remarkable archeological finds that revolutionized our understanding of these trade routes. Hansen explores eight sites along the road, from Xi'an to Samarkand, where merchants, envoys, pilgrims, and travelers mixed in cosmopolitan communities, tolerant of religions from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism.<br><br>Designed for use in the classroom and based on the award-winning trade edition (OUP, 2012), <em>The Silk Road: A New History with Documents</em> offers a selection of excerpted primary sources in each chapter. The wide-ranging sources include memoirs of medieval Chinese monks and modern explorers, letters written by women, descriptions of towns, legal contracts, religious hymns, and many others. A new final chapter provides coverage of the Silk Road during the period of Mongol rule.<br></p><p><br><strong>Valerie Hansen </strong>is Professor of History at Yale University. She is the author of several books, including <em>The Open Empire</em>, Second Edition (2015), and, with Kenneth R.

With the new documents, this version gives an even more vivid picture of how the 'Silk Road' actually functioned. It is perfect for classroom use."--Christopher P. Atwood, <em>University of Pennsylvania</em> <br><p></p><br>"In 2013 the International Convention of Asia Scholars recognized <em>The Silk Road: A New History</em> as the best new book about Asia for teaching the humanities. That is no small praise, and I could not readily agree more. Indeed, for anyone who teaches the Silk Road--or Asian or world history--this updated version that includes a remarkable array of original sources is an absolute boon. Not only because it is beautifully written and cogently offers up a magisterial overview of Inner Asian history up through the Mongol conquest, but also, more importantly, because it weaves into its narrative the excitement of discovery that lies at the heart of the humanities."--Johan Elverskog, <em>Southern Methodist University</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Silk Road</em> is a remarkable achievement, especially considering the extreme complexity of the subject matter. This useful and timely text provides teachers and students of Chinese, Asian, and world history a much-needed collection of primary sources on the Silk Road in the first millennium and beyond. The selected prayers, contracts, personal correspondence, and graffiti tell extremely vivid, personal, factual stories and promise to generate stimulating class discussion.

He waited, savoring the moment, and then he unlocked a cage on the panel and pulled down a small red bar.<br>There was no hum, no sound, nothing to indicate that the most expensive scientific instrument on earth had been turned on. Except that, two hundred miles away, the lights of Las Vegas dimmed ever so slightly.<br>As Isabella warmed up, Dolby began to feel the fine vibration of her through the floor. He thought of the machine as a woman, and in his more imaginative moments he had even imagined what she looked like&#x2014;tall and slender, with a muscular back, black as the desert night, beaded with sweat. Isabella. He had shared these feelings with no one&#x2014;no point in attracting ridicule. To the rest of the scientists on the project, Isabella was an &#x201c;it,&#x201d; a dead machine built for a specific purpose. But Dolby had always felt a deep affection for the machines he created&#x2014;from when he was ten years old and constructed his first radio from a kit. Fred. That was the radio&#x2019;s name. And when he thought of Fred, he saw a fat carroty-haired white man. The first computer he had built was Betty&#x2014;who looked in his head like a brisk and efficient secretary. He couldn&#x2019;t explain why his machines took on the personalities they did&#x2014;it just happened.<br>And now this, the world&#x2019;s most powerful particle accelerator...

Hazelius strode across the small room and positioned himself in front of the biggest of the plasma screens. Small, slight, as sleek and restless as a caged mink, he paced in front of the screen for a moment before turning to them with a brilliant smile. It never ceased to amaze Dolby what a charismatic presence the man had.<br>&#x201c;My dear friends,&#x201d; he began, scanning the group with turquoise eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s 1492. We&#x2019;re at the bow of the Santa Maria, gazing at the sea horizon, moments before the coastline of the New World comes into view.

Because tonight, we bring Isabella to one hundred percent full power.&#x201d;<br>Silence greeted the announcement. Finally Kate Mercer, the assistant director of the project, spoke. &#x201c;What happened to the plan to do three runs at ninety-five percent?&#x201d;<br>Hazelius returned her look with a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m impatient.

Is she ready?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re damn right she&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br>Hazelius spread his hands. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br>Everyone looked at each other. Should they risk it? Volkonsky, the Russian programmer, suddenly broke the ice. &#x201c;Yes, we go for it!&#x201d; He high-fived a startled Hazelius, and then everyone began slapping each other on the back, shaking hands, and hugging, like a basketball team before a game.Five hours and as many bad coffees later, Dolby stood before the huge flat-panel screen. It was still dark&#x2014;the matter&#x2013;antimatter proton beams had not been brought into contact. It took forever to power up the machine and cool down Isabella&#x2019;s superconducting magnets to carry the very large currents necessary. Then it was a matter of increasing beam luminosity by increments of 5 percent, focusing and collimating the beams, checking the superconducting magnets, running various test programs, before going up to the next 5 percent.<br>&#x201c;Power at ninety percent,&#x201d; Dolby intoned.<br>&#x201c;Christ damn,&#x201d; said Volkonsky somewhere behind him, giving the Sunbeam coffeemaker a blow that made it rattle like the Tin Man. &#x201c;Empty already!&#x201d;<br>Dolby repressed a smile. During the two weeks they&#x2019;d been up on the mesa, Volkonsky had revealed himself as a wiseass, a slouching, mangy specimen of Eurotrash with long greasy hair, ripped T-shirts, and a pubic clump of beard clinging to his chin. He looked more like a drug addict than a brilliant software engineer. But then, a lot of them were like that.<br>Another measured ticking of the clock.<br>&#x201c;Beams aligned and focused,&#x201d; said Rae Chen. &#x201c;Luminosity fourteen TeV.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Isabella work fine,&#x201d; said Volkonsky.<br>&#x201c;My systems are all green,&#x201d; said Cecchini, the particle physicist.<br>&#x201c;Security, Mr. Wardlaw?&#x201d;<br>The senior intelligence officer, Wardlaw, spoke from his security station. &#x201c;Just cactus and coyotes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Hazelius. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time.&#x201d; He paused dramatically. &#x201c;Ken? Bring the beams into collision.&#x201d;<br>Dolby felt a quickening of his heart. He touched the dials with his spiderlike fingers, adjusting them with a pianist&#x2019;s lightness of touch. He followed with a series of commands rapped into the keyboard.<br>&#x201c;Contact.&#x201d;<br>The huge flat-panel screens all around suddenly woke up. A sudden singing noise seemed to float in the air, coming from everywhere and nowhere at once.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Mercer asked, alarmed.<br>&#x201c;A trillion particles blowing through the detectors,&#x201d; said Dolby. &#x201c;Sets up a high vibration.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus, it sounds like the monolith in 2001.&#x201d;<br>Volkonsky hooted like an ape. Everyone ignored him.<br>An image appeared on the central panel, the Visualizer. Dolby stared at it, entranced. It was like an enormous flower&#x2014;flickering jets of color radiating from a single point, twisting and writhing as if trying to tear free of the screen. He stood in awe at the intense beauty of it.<br>&#x201c;Contact successful,&#x201d; said Rae Chen. &#x201c;Beams are focused and collimated. God, it&#x2019;s a perfect alignment!&#x201d;<br>Cheers and some ragged clapping.<br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; said Hazelius, &#x201c;welcome to the shores of the New World.&#x201d; He gestured to the Visualizer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking at an energy density not seen in the universe since the Big Bang.&#x201d; He turned to Dolby. &#x201c;Ken, please increase power in increments of tenths to ninety-nine.&#x201d;<br>The ethereal sound increased slightly as Dolby worked on the keyboard. &#x201c;Ninety-six,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Luminosity seventeen point four TeV,&#x201d; said Chen.<br>&#x201c;Ninety-seven... Ninety-eight.&#x201d;<br>The team fell into tense silence, the only sound now the humming that filled the underground control room, as if the mountain around them were singing.<br>&#x201c;Beams still focused,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;Luminosity twenty-two point five TeV.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine.&#x201d;<br>The sound from Isabella had become still higher, purer.<br>&#x201c;Just a moment,&#x201d; said Volkonsky, hunching over the supercomputer workstation. &#x201c;Isabella is... slow.&#x201d;<br>Dolby turned sharply. &#x201c;Nothing wrong with the hardware. It must be another software glitch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Software not problem,&#x201d; said Volkonsky.<br>&#x201c;Maybe we should hold it here,&#x201d; said Mercer. &#x201c;Any evidence of miniature black hole creation?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;Not a trace of Hawking radiation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point five,&#x201d; said Dolby.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting a charged jet at twenty-two point seven TeV,&#x201d; said Chen.<br>&#x201c;What kind?&#x201d; asked Hazelius.<br>&#x201c;An unknown resonance. Take a look.&#x201d;<br>Two flickering red lobes had developed on either side of the flower on the central screen, like a clown&#x2019;s ears gone wild.<br>&#x201c;Hard-scattering,&#x201d; said Hazelius. &#x201c;Gluons maybe. Might be evidence of a Kaluza-Klein graviton.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;Not at this luminosity.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point six.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gregory, I think we should hold the power steady here,&#x201d; said Mercer. &#x201c;A lot of stuff is happening all at once.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Naturally we&#x2019;re seeing unknown resonances,&#x201d; Hazelius said, his voice no louder than the rest, but somehow distinct from them all. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in unknown territory.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point seven,&#x201d; Dolby intoned. He had complete confidence in his machine. He could take her to one hundred percent and beyond, if necessary. It gave him a thrill to know they were now sucking up almost a quarter of the juice from Hoover Dam. That was why they had to do their runs in the middle of the night&#x2014;when power usage was lowest.<br>&#x201c;Ninety-nine point eight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got some kind of really big unknown interaction here,&#x201d; said Mercer.<br>&#x201c;What is problem, bitch?&#x201d; Volkonsky shouted at the computer.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, we&#x2019;re poking our finger into a Kaluza-Klein space,&#x201d; said Chen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s incredible.&#x201d;<br>Snow began to appear on the big flat panel with the flower.<br>&#x201c;Isabella is behave strange,&#x201d; said Volkonsky.<br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d; Hazeli...</p></p><h2>Regulus (Latin)</h2><p>In 2000 Harcourt proudly reissued Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry's masterpiece, The Little Prince, in a sparkling new format.

She&#x2019;s not sure what to make of this family trip to China, and didn&#x2019;t want to leave her friends for the summer, but she&#x2019;s excited about the prospect of exploring with her Aunt Lin, the only adult who truly understands her.<br> <br>Then Aunt Lin disappears, right after her old nemesis, a man named Ying, comes to visit.

It might have been bright red once upon a time. But the years had patched it with stains and lighter portions where the leather had worn away. <br> <br>Mia helped Aunt Lin lug the trunk from the closet, each of them grabbing a dark metal handle. The trunk was heavier than it looked, and Mia was already noodle-�armed from jet lag. She&#x2019;d arrived in China less than twenty-four hours ago, and most of that time had been spent in transit&#x2014;taking the train from Shanghai to Fuzhou, and then the taxi here, to this apartment. Her eyes kept slipping shut, trying to remind her that while it was midafternoon in Fuzhou, it was the middle of the night back in America.<br> <br>Once the trunk was out in the open, Mia saw that it was nearly large enough for her to climb inside. An image came to her&#x2014;a snapshot of her curled in the trunk like a sleeping fairy, waiting for someone to wake her. Or maybe bound like a prisoner, straining at the rope around her wrists. That was the more exciting story, the kind Mia usually liked. But right now, sleeping for a hundred years sounded like the better option.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lost in your head again?&#x201d; Aunt Lin smiled and brushed a strand of hair from Mia&#x2019;s face, bringing her back from her imaginings. &#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s see what&#x2019;s in this thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>She rummaged around the nightstand until she produced an ancient-looking key. Mia was surprised her aunt still knew her way around. Aunt Lin and Mia&#x2019;s mother had grown up in this apartment, but it had been years and years since they&#x2019;d been here last.<br> <br>Mia had expected them to feel like she did&#x2014;a puzzle piece that didn&#x2019;t fit. <br> <br>Glum again, she pulled her knees against her chest. This month-long visit to China was supposed to be a Great Opportunity for Mia and her older brother, Jake, to see where their family had come from. The last time they&#x2019;d visited, Mia had been so little she barely remembered it.<br> <br>You loved it, Mia&#x2019;s mother had said. You had so much fun.<br> <br>But back then, Mia hadn&#x2019;t met Thea and Lizbeth yet. She hadn&#x2019;t cared that the trip would rip her from home for a third of summer vacation. The three of them hadn&#x2019;t spent a summer apart in years. Mia would make it back just in time to celebrate her twelfth birthday, but that wasn&#x2019;t much consolation.<br> <br>A month was a long time to be apart from your best friends. <br> <br>Anything might happen.<br> <br>Aunt Lin sat and tucked an arm around Mia so they sloped against each other. &#x201c;Do you want to open it?&#x201d; she said, holding out the key. She grinned, like they were explorers&#x2014;or maybe adventurous archaeologists, having just unearthed a treasure. She knew how much Mia enjoyed mysteries.<br> <br>The lock turned with a satisfying click. Mia opened the lid slowly and peeked inside.<br> <br>The first thing she saw was a big, square book. It wasn&#x2019;t until she laid it open in her lap that she realized it wasn&#x2019;t a book at all, but a photo album. Inside, the photos weren&#x2019;t slipped into plastic pockets, but pasted onto black paper pages, like a scrapbook. <br> <br>&#x201c;Can you recognize your mother and me in any of those?&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. She was lifting other things out of the trunk&#x2014;a small frame of embroidered silk, a slender, cloth-wrapped vase. For a minute, Mia was too distracted to look at the album. <br> <br>But she couldn&#x2019;t keep her eyes away for long. She squinted at each picture. Some were tiny, barely bigger than a postage stamp. Others were the size of her palm. All were black-and-white, though a couple looked like someone had tried to color them in afterward and hadn&#x2019;t done a very good job. <br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mom,&#x201d; Mia said, pointing at a family photo. <br> <br>Her mother and Aunt Lin bookended a collection of four children, Aunt Lin the eldest, Mia&#x2019;s mother the baby. In the photograph, all four siblings gathered in a solemn huddle around the seated forms of Mia&#x2019;s late grandmother and grandfather. Her mother was barely more than a toddler, but she had the same sweet, round face she had now. <br> <br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s you, with the braids.&#x201d; This time, Mia pointed at the eldest child. The girl was maybe fourteen&#x2014;�around Jake&#x2019;s age. There was a familiar glint in her dark eyes, as if she were thinking of a joke. <br> <br>On the next page, Mia found a picture of just the two of them&#x2014;her mother and Aunt Lin holding hands and laughing at the camera. This time her mom looked to be four or five. <br> <br>&#x201c;That was the first day of my senior year of high school,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. &#x201c;One of your grandmother&#x2019;s friends borrowed a camera from someone.&#x201d;<br> <br>She smiled and took the photo album in her careful, life-weathered hands. &#x201c;Life-weathered&#x201d; was a term Mia had learned from Aunt Lin, since no one but Aunt Lin used it. Her aunt liked to mash English words together, or substitute one word in a common phrase for another that suited her better. You understand what I mean, she&#x2019;d say, and Mia always did.<br> <br>The two of them weren&#x2019;t like the rest of the people in Mia&#x2019;s little family. They weren&#x2019;t like Mia&#x2019;s mom, who was always punctual, and loved to-do lists, and never let her thoughts wander off when they were supposed to be pinned down. They weren&#x2019;t like Jake, who did well in school without even trying, who always had people inviting him over to play basketball, or soccer, or tennis. <br> <br>They weren&#x2019;t like Mia&#x2019;s dad, who&#x2019;d left one day when Mia was little and never came back.<br> <br>They were only like each other. Cotton-candy-headed, as Mia&#x2019;s mom sometimes teased; Weird, as Jake always complained. They loved stories and history and make-believe&#x2014;�and the exciting places where those things blurred into one another.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. &#x201c;This is a picture of me during the Chinese New Year. I was nineteen&#x2014;it was my first time home after being sent down to the countryside.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia studied the picture. It was hard to tell in the black-and-white photo, but her aunt looked heavily tanned. Her hair was still in braids, her smile secret and winking. <br> <br>When a younger Mia had first heard her aunt&#x2019;s stories about her years in the countryside, she&#x2019;d thought they sounded pretty exciting. Mia didn&#x2019;t have a head for school. She daydreamed through math and English classes alike, distracted by every passing noise in the hallway. Her teachers were always telling her to sit still, to keep her eyes forward. <br> <br>To think about something that wasn&#x2019;t fantasy.<br> <br>She thought she would have preferred tramping around outdoors every day, planting baby rice shoots, or hand-making bricks, or threshing wheat. She&#x2019;d helped out at Thea&#x2019;s horse barn before, and that had been fun, the two of them giggling through their tasks and getting straw in their hair. <br> <br>But she knew Aunt Lin had wanted to go straight to university after high school. She&#x2019;d dreamed of becoming a history professor&#x2014;not of being stuck doing farm work in rural China. She&#x2019;d been there nearly three years before being allowed to come home again. Only then had she applied for university. <br> <br>&#x201c;Were you homesick?&#x201d; Mia said. &#x201c;When you were down in the country?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. &#x201c;I missed my old friends. I missed my family&#x2014;especially your mother! She was my little darling.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia always felt funny when she tried to think of her mother as a child&#x2014;small enough to be someone&#x2019;s little darling. She was so grown up now. <br> <br>&#x201c;Ah! Here it is.&#x201d; Aunt Lin had gotten to the bottom of the trunk, and she lifted something swathed in layers of cloth. Mia pressed closer as her aunt undid the wrappings.<br> <br>It was a Chinese brush painting of two black-and-white cranes. One had its wings lifted wide, as if in a dance. The other stared at the sky, its long neck curved in a sinuous S. Both bore a flash of red at the crowns of their delicate heads. Behind them stretched a rolling landscape of mountain peaks and valleys, cut through by a winding stream.<br> <br>Aunt Lin sat back on her knees, the painting in her lap. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen this in a long, long time. It was your grandmother&#x2019;s favorite painting. She used to hang it in her bedroom, right there&#x2014;&#x201d; She pointed to an empty spot on the wall by the closet door. &#x201c;That way, she could see it every morning when she got out of bed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia&#x2019;s grandparents had passed away long ago. She&#x2019;d never even met them. Sometimes her mother or Aunt Lin would bring them up&#x2014;say things like, Oh, remember what Mom used to do? or Dad always liked those, but mostly, Mia&#x2019;s grandparents were a mystery to her. The majority of her extended family was. <br> <br>She tried to picture the woman her grandmother had been once upon a time. Someone who&#x2019;d loved these dainty cranes so much she&#x2019;d hung them in her bedroom. Someone who&#x2019;d breathed and hummed and walked through this apartment, her feet pressed against the same floors Mia sat on now. <br> <br>&#x201c;Did Uncle take the painting down after she died?&#x201d; Mia asked. Only her uncle still lived in this apartment. Aunt Lin and Mia&#x2019;s mother had moved to the United States long ago, and their remaining sister lived hours away, in another city. <br> <br>Aunt Lin shook her head. &#x201c;Your grandmother took it down herself. I think I was in middle school then, or maybe high school. This painting is a family heirloom&#x2014;it&#x2019;s very old and very precious. It&#x2019;s a piece of history.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Was she afraid someone would break it?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a beat of silence before Aunt Lin answered. &#x201c;There was a time when no one in China wanted anything to do with things that were old, and precious, and pieces of history,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Or if they did&#x2014;they kept quiet about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The room grew still. Mia got the shivery, unsettled feeling she always did when her aunt&#x2019;s mood dipped. Aunt Lin was seldom sad, but when she did get that way, it felt like doors closing in Mia&#x2019;s face. Like her aunt withdrew somewhere deep inside herself, where Mia couldn&#x2019;t follow. <br> <br>Mia hated that more than anything. Even more than when Aunt Lin got overly excited about something and wandered off. At least then Mia could think of her aunt as a daredevil traveler&#x2014;a swashbuckling heroine like those in Mia&#x2019;s favorite books. Besides, Aunt Lin always warned Mia before leaving on one of her sudden journeys, even if she forgot to tell anyone else.<br> <br>The one time she hadn&#x2019;t, Mia had cried every day Aunt Lin was gone. Your aunt has always been like this, her mother had said in an attempt to comfort her. She gets hooked by something&#x2014;a new exhibition on tombs, a talk about ancient kings&#x2014;and forgets everything else. Don&#x2019;t worry. She always finds her way back.<br> <br>But this had happened only months after Mia&#x2019;s parents had divorced; Mia had been very little. She hadn&#x2019;t believed that anyone who&#x2019;d leave so abruptly would come home again.<br> <br>Once she returned a few days later, Aunt Lin had sworn up and down that she&#x2019;d never again take off without leaving Mia a message. That she&#x2019;d never be gone when Mia needed her.<br> <br>In all the years since, she&#x2019;d never broken that promise.<br> <br>Mia rested her chin against her aunt&#x2019;s shoulder and racked her brain for something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;helpful to say. Something that would bring her aunt back to her. &#x201c;Can we take the painting with us when we leave? If your brother doesn&#x2019;t want it? You could hang it in your bedroom at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>To her relief, Aunt Lin laughed. &#x201c;Maybe we can. But it&#x2019;s far too early to talk about leaving&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve only just arrived. Did you want to see where my school used to be? Or the park where your mother liked to play when she was little?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia just hugged Aunt Lin even tighter. &#x201c;Will you take me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. She kissed the top of Mia&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to spend this whole trip together. I promise.&#x201d;</p><h2>Sacred Is the Call: Formation and Transformation in Spiritual Direction Programs</h2><p>Presented by Mercy Center, a leading spiritual direction program in the United States, this handbook addresses questions asked by every spiritual direction trainer about how to present key topics.

During these historic walkouts, or "blowouts," the students were led by Sal Castro, a courageous and charismatic Mexican American teacher who encouraged the students to make their grievances public after school administrators and school board members failed to listen to them. The resulting blowouts sparked the beginning of the urban Chicano Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the largest and most widespread civil rights protests by Mexican Americans in U.S. history. <br><br>This fascinating <i>testimonio</i>, or oral history, transcribed and presented in Castro's voice by historian Mario T. Garcia, is a compelling, highly readable narrative of a young boy growing up in Los Angeles who made history by his leadership in the blowouts and in his career as a dedicated and committed teacher. <i>Blowout!</i> fills a major void in the history of the civil rights and Chicano movements of the 1960s, particularly the struggle for educational justice.<br><br></p><p>"Garcia's oeuvre has mapped Mexican American history and allowed us to imagine a different kind of past--one filled with efforts to rectify social injustices.

Because many believers have a limited view of their great Advocate, Counselor, Helper, and Companion, they don't realize that in day-to-day life they can depend on Him to...</p> <ul> <li>encourage, guide, and correct them, and prompt them to speak or act appropriately</li> <li>help them identify deep motives and penetrate to the root of personal struggles</li> <li>help them discern in prayer what is best in a situation</li></ul> <p>When believers build their lives upon reliance on the Spirit, they can live confidently in life's stressful situations and relationships, knowing they have a Friend who is always there to help. </p></p><p>Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie has authored more than 50 books, including Conversation with God, When You Need a Miracle, and the immensely popular daily devotional God&#x2019;s Best for My Life.

Now he maintains a busy schedule of leading Preaching with Passion Conferences for pastors and motivational speaking throughout the world."Dr. Ogilvie has opened my eyes to the great spirit of our creator. He has shown me that this power is available in our lives if we but seek it."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Max Cleland, U.S. Senator (Retired)</strong><br><br>"Without any reservation I recommend this inspirational and inspiring masterpiece from Dr. Ogilvie. I believe that Dr. Ogilvie realized and achieved God's plan for him to present the Holy Spirit to all Christians as &#x2018;The Counselor,' affirming the Trinity as an essential in Christianity. It truly blessed and inspired me."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joe Cathey, Jr.</strong><br><br>"<strong><em>Experiencing the Power of the Holy Spirit</em></strong> is one of the best books I have ever read. For me, it was very meaningful. Since reading the book, I have bought at least 10 other copies and given them away to family and friends. Dr. Ogilvie's insight is incredible.

For ingredients, take the classical French cuisine, combine it with Spanish classical cuisine, blend well, take herbs and spices from France and Spain and sometimes couple with seasoning learned from the Choctaws and Chickasaws. Then be sure to add the ingenuity, the creativity and the keen taste of the refugee Acadians.... Now, add the exotic taste and magic seasoning of the African cook. Voila! This is Acadian cuisine."<p> The differences between Cajun and Creole cuisines are explained (the Creole cuisine of New Orleans is fattier and more highly seasoned), then the home cook is treated to more than 200 recipes, from breakfast to dessert, designed to bring forth the bayou.Favorites such as fried okra and Maque Choux are represented, as well as 11 different gumbos (even one with squirrel!) and seven recipes for Jambalaya. There's a recipe for Alligator Stew, plus two ways to prepare frog legs, and the book closes with a generous dessert section, which naturally includes Pecan Pralines and Tarte � la Bouillie, a classic Cajun custard pie. The recipes are simple and straightforward and have clearly been tested in homes for the past couple of centuries--no processors or microwaves need apply; all you need is a sharp knife and a big iron pan.

Her article on the origins and nature and component parts of cajun cooking is the most scholarly and informed on the subject. Mrs. Comeaux-Manuel became a consultant on the production of the book and the article became a component of the book. <p>Mr. Angers published this book in respone to a perception that so many were seeking to know and understand what comprises authentic cajun cuisine and to fulfill that need.</p></p><h2>The Napping House Lap Board Book</h2><p>On a cozy bed lie a snoring granny, a dreaming child, a dozing dog, a snoozing cat, and a tiny slumbering mouse.

How do you create suspense in your books? </p><p><strong>Jennifer McMahon:</strong> When I sit down to write, I typically don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going to happen next. I start with an idea and ask questions. Then I start writing to find out the answers. I think the fact that I don&#x2019;t know, that I&#x2019;m just kind of letting the story tell itself and show me where it wants to go helps me keep it suspenseful. If I&#x2019;m on the edge of my seat, then I&#x2019;m thinking that maybe the readers will be, too. When I wrote the first draft of this book, I didn&#x2019;t know who the killer was, and the idea that it could be any of the characters kept me on edge.</p><p><strong>MA:</strong> Reggie, the main character in the book, returns to her hometown after her mother&#x2014;missing twenty-five years has been found alive. The book shifts between Reggie&#x2019;s life as a teenager in the 1980s and the present. What made you choose this structure?</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> I think at their heart, my books are studies of the choices people make often really bad choices-and the way those choices, along with the secrets we keep, can shape our lives, even change the people we turn out to be. I wanted to show how Reggie became the person she is today; how the events that took place one summer shaped her forever, and how now, she&#x2019;s got to go back to that summer and face it, whether she wants to or not.</p><p><strong>MA:</strong> You depict Reggie&#x2019;s adolescent experience so vividly-all the insecurities, romantic confusion and longing, the feverish intensity of friendships among young girls. Are you particularly drawn to writing about this age group?</p><p><strong>JM:</strong> For whatever reason, writing these types of characters these quirky, imaginative, misfit girls somewhere between 6 and 15comes naturally to me. I think my own childhood and early adolescence was a particularly bizarre, difficult and yet magical time, so that period is still very vivid in my head, and thankfully, flows easily onto the page.</p><p><strong>MA:</strong> Even though <em>The One I Left Behind</em> is a mystery, at its heart are a pair of relationships: Reggie and her best friend Tara, and Reggie and her mother, Vera, a former model with a complicated personal life. How do you balance relationships and plot?</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> I think the two are interconnected: the relationships shape the plot and the plot shapes the way the characters behave toward one another. For me, they develop together. I often learn about my characters and their relationships to the people in their lives by making terrible things happen nothing like loved ones in jeopardy to put all your relationships to the test!</p><p><strong>MA:</strong> It strikes me that suspense is a very &#x201c;intimate&#x201d; genre. The relationship between the author and the reader is so intense because the author tries to generate such powerful responses in the reader. Do you feel that way?</p><p><strong>JM:</strong> I think you&#x2019;re absolutely right! We&#x2019;re taking people to some pretty dark places and showing them some scary stuff.

Then he said, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m a fifty-fifty guy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This is who might be deciding your case&#x2014;a &#x201c;fifty-fifty guy&#x201d; or maybe an &#x201c;every other weekend guy&#x201d; or a &#x201c;no overnights guy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But your family isn&#x2019;t a case, is it? We&#x2019;re talking about your baby. <br> &nbsp;<br> As I discuss in Chapter 4, expert opinion about the best schedule for babies is all over the map. Some suggest that parents should swap their babies across households. Frequently. There are experts who argue that babies benefit from swapping homes, and cribs, every day or two.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the other extreme are experts who think it is fine for a very young child to have a daytime visit, or two, with the &#x201c;other&#x201d; parent every week, or two. Many experts on this side of the fence tell parents that infants and toddlers should sleep in the same bed every night, and have the same caregiver available to comfort them, if needed. Some want this pattern to continue until a child reaches age four or so.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then there are the courts. Judges all over America, all over the world, are faced with warring parents, dueling experts, and the politics of &#x201c;mothers&#x2019; rights&#x201d; versus &#x201c;fathers&#x2019; rights.&#x201d; In the face of controversy and uncertainty, some judges are ordering parents to raise their babies according to untenable, seemingly abusive schedules. Breastfeeding can be used as a reason to deny more than a few hours of visitation with the father&#x2014;or condemned as a manipulative tactic of &#x201c;visitation interference.&#x201d; Some judges allow parents to see their babies only for a few brief hours, every other weekend. Other judges order parents to transport their babies across long distances so they can swap their infant on a schedule where a week or more passes before the child sees the other parent again.<br> &nbsp;<br> What does such a grand experiment in &#x201c;fairness&#x201d; do to an infant?<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the course of decades of practice and research on child custody disputes, I have refused a great many invitations to appear in court as an expert witness. My reasoning was (and remains) simple. I want parents to work together, make their own coparenting decisions, and stay out of court.<br> &nbsp;<br> After more than thirty years of work as a psychologist, family therapist, mediator, and researcher, I broke my rule. A few years ago, I was compelled by outrage to testify in court for the first and only time in my long career. My testimony, in essence, suggested that a judge had erred in awarding week on/week off custody to the parents of a one-year-old baby. The parents lived a six-hour drive apart from each other. They were so angry and uncooperative that when they met on the highway to swap their baby, they refused to share information&#x2014;or blankets, cuddly toys, or even medicine.<br> &nbsp;<br> To the judge, the plan seemed fair to everyone. It may have been, except to the most important one: the baby.</p><h2>Tudor Christmas</h2><p>Review: &#34;[A] jewel of a book.&#34; (Tracy Borman BBC History Magazine, **Books of the Year**) / About the Author: Alison Weir is one of Britain&#39;s top-selling historians.

Courageous Dreaming tells us how to dream our world with power and grace. The ancient shamans of the Americas understood that we&#x2019;re not only creating our experience of the world, but are dreaming up the very nature of reality itself&#x2014;that is, "life is but a dream." When you don&#x2019;t dream your life, you have to settle for the nightmare being dreamed by others. This book shows how to wake up from the collective nightmare and begin to dream a life of courage and grace, a sacred dream that shamans throughout time have known and served.Alberto Villoldo reveals ancient wisdom teachings that explain how to birth reality from the invisible matrix of creation; and reveals how we can interact with this matrix to dream a life of peace, health, and abundance.

Stephen the Third, the king of England, has just died, and Mass (Mozart&#x2019;s second requiem) is about to be sung to lay him to rest. In the choir is our hero, Hubert Anvil, an extremely ordinary ten-year-old boy with a faultless voice. In the audience is a select group of experts whose job is to determine whether that faultless voice should be preserved by performing a certain operation. Art, after all, is worth any sacrifice.<br><br>How Hubert realizes what lies in store for him and how he deals with the whirlpool of piety, menace, terror, and passion that he soon finds himself in are the subject of a classic piece of counterfactual fiction equal to Philip K.

Campbell Memorial Award for best science-fiction novel in 1976.</p><p>Hubert, the ten-year-old chorister&#39;s glorious voice must be preserved at all costs. In Amis&#39;s quasi-medieval England of 1976, a wickedly brilliant Swiftian satire takes shape. The modest proposal? Well, it stands to reason that castration is clearly the only answer.Kingsley Amis (1922&#x2013;1995) was a popular and prolific British novelist, poet, and critic, widely regarded as one of the greatest satirical writers of the twentieth century. Born in suburban South London, the only child of a clerk in the office of the mustard-maker Colman&#x2019;s, he went to the City of London School on the Thames before winning an English scholarship to St. John&#x2019;s College, Oxford, where he began a lifelong friendship with fellow student Philip Larkin. Following service in the British Army&#x2019;s Royal Corps of Signals during World War II , he completed his degree and joined the faculty at the University College of Swansea in Wales. <i>Lucky Jim</i>, his first novel, appeared in 1954 to great acclaim and won a Somerset Maugham Award. Amis spent a year as a visiting fellow in the creative writing department of Princeton University and in 1961 became a fellow at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, but resigned the position two years later, lamenting the incompatibility of writing and teaching (&#x201c;I found myself fit for nothing much more exacting than playing the gramophone after three supervisions a day&#x201d;). Ultimately he published twenty-four novels, including science fiction and a James Bond sequel; more than a dozen collections of poetry, short stories, and literary criticism; restaurant reviews and three books about drinking; political pamphlets and a memoir; and more. Amis received the Booker Prize for his novel <i>The Old Devils</i> in 1986 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990. He had three children, among them the novelist Martin Amis, with his first wife, Hilary Anne Bardwell, from whom he was divorced in 1965. After his second, eighteen-year marriage to the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard ended in 1983, he lived in a London house with his first wife and her third husband.<br><br>William Gibson is the author of many novels, including <i>Neuromancer</i> and <i>Pattern Recognition</i>.

These are the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in North America dating back as far as 1100 C.E. Up until the mid-twentieth century, the Hopi kept a secret, an oral tradition of foreknowledge&#x2014;signs presaging an end of an old and perhaps a beginning of a new world. The milestones listed are specific. For instance, they anticipated the coming of the white people from the East bearing their sign of the cross, herding their long-horned cattle and the first sign of wheels came to Hopi lands attached to their covered wagons. The iron roads with their iron horses, the iron ropes suspended in the air (telegraph wires) and later the &#x201c;cobwebs&#x201d; of airplane contrails crisscrossing the skies, all fulfilled the opening prophetic stages indicating that the Great Purification by Fire was at hand. The test firing of the first atomic bomb in 1945, not far from Hopi lands in neighboring New Mexico prompted the Hopi to end their centuries of silence. The &#x201c;Gourd of Ashes&#x201d; had arrived, the shape of its rising mushroom cloud foretold in the metaphor of a round gourd stood on its long neck. It was the Hopi elders&#x2019; cue that it was time to reveal to people of all races a short list of final warnings heralding the world&#x2019;s purification either by the fire of nuclear war and runaway global warming, or by a fire of a burning love and conscious concern for the Earth and each other. Once again author and prophecy scholar John Hogue takes a large and involved prophetic subject and distills it down to its essentials for a quick and comprehensive read that includes the shared visions of many Native American nations about the coming of the Europeans to North America and the death and renewal of our world. &#x201c;I have known John Hogue for fifteen years, during which time he has appeared on my radio program many, many times. Every year, he predicts on the program in the first quarter and we &#x2018;hold his feet to the fire&#x2019; during the summer. And every year, he proves to be fireproof. He&#x2019;s accurate.

Hogue is a world-renowned expert on the prophecies of Nostradamus and other prophetic traditions. He claims to focus on interpreting the world&#x2019;s ancient-to-modern prophets and prophecies with fresh eyes, seeking to connect readers with the shared and collective visions of terror, wonder and revelation about the future in a conversational narrative style.

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. According to Yogananda, &#34;Self-realization is the knowing - in body, mind, and soul - that we are one with the omnipresence of God; that we do not have to pray that it come to us, that we are not merely near it at all times, but that God&#39;s omnipresence is our omnipresence; that we are just as much a part of Him now as we ever will be. All we have to do is improve our knowing.&#34; According to an Amazon Reviewer: &#34;This is an excellent little booklet which was originally given to Yogananda&#39;s initiates after initiation. It is of great value to those researching the legacy of Swami Yogananda. If you&#39;ve ever wondered whether the techniques currently taught by SRF are the same as the techniques taught by Yogananda to his early disciples, then this booklet is for you. The major differences between the kriya yoga of this booklet and that of the current SRF initiation is as follows: 1) Mantra is &#34;sung&#34; in each chakra 2) Khechari (not by name) is discussed. 3) The path of the breath (&#34;life force&#34;) is elliptical as it is explained in Autobiography of a Yogi. The techniques of this little booklet brought many of Yogananda&#39;s early disciples to Samadhi and beyond.</p><p></p><h2>Manly Dominion</h2><p>Mark Chanski&#39;s book is a clarion call to all Christian men to face life&#39;s challenges with Manly Dominion.

E. Housman's <i>A Shropshire Lad</i>, first published in 1896. Scholars and critics have seen in these timeless poems an elegance of taste and perfection of form and feeling comparable to the greatest of the classic. Yet their simple language, strong musical cadences and direct emotional appeal have won these works a wide audience among general readers as well.<br>This finely produced volume, reprinted from an authoritative edition of <i>A Shropshire Lad</i>, contains all 63 original poems along with a new Index of First Lines and a brief new section of Notes to the Text. Here are poems that deal poignantly with the changing climate of friendship, the fading of youth, the vanity of dreams &#x2014; poems that are among the most read, shared, and quoted in our language.</p><p></p></p><p>Housman was a classical scholar and poet.Housman is a high-water mark of British lyric poetry, and this fine production captures perfectly his strong, melodic beat and decisive rhyme, and his wonderful way with words. Samuel West's cultivated Midlands accent may not be specifically Shropshire, but his voice and reading are true to Housman who was not, after all, some rough Shropshire lad himself but an Oxford don. His <i>Loveliest of Trees, the Cherry Now</i> and <i>To an Athlete Dying Young</i> are beautifully rendered here. West, you feel, reads poetry as it should be read confidently, with ease and conviction, as if all the world spoke in meter and rhyme. --D.A.W., AudioFile Magazine</p><h2>Only Death Is Real: An Illustrated History of Hellhammer and Early Celtic Frost 1981 1985</h2><p><br>This formidable oversized hardcover runs 288 pages (including a 32-page color section), and combines hundreds of unseen early Hellhammer and Celtic Frost photos with a vast treasure trove of artwork and memorabilia. A substantial written component by Fischer details his upbringing on the outskirts of Zurich, Switzerland, and the hardships and triumphs he faced bringing the visions of his groundbreaking bands Hellhammer and eventually Celtic Frost to reality. In addition, the book includes an introduction by Nocturno Culto of Norwegian black metal act Darkthrone, and a foreword by noted metal author Joel McIver.<br><br>Without question Only Death Is Real goes farther than any other source in exploring the origins of underground heavy metal. The wealth of visual information is astounding, both in terms of documenting early 1980s headbangers and exposing the still-relevant imagery of the first Hellhammer and Celtic Frost photo sessions. On top of that, the written chapters combine Tom Fischer&#x2019;s often shocking stories with lengthy quotes from Martin Eric Ain and the other main Hellhammer members, explaining in intimately human terms how extreme metal was born.</p><p>In the early 1980s in the rural outskirts of Zurich, Switzerland, author Tom Gabriel Fischer assembled the groundbreaking heavy metal band Hellhammer&#x2014;a dark, dramatic force that flew in opposition to his surroundings in every way, even the flashy party-hearty hard rock music of the day. Slowly, Fischer pulled together an ever-larger legion of similar-minded outcasts and adventurers. In a few short years, Hellhammer vanished and Celtic Frost was born, and in this remarkable volume the tale is told with vivid photographs and exacting narrative detail.nly Death Is Real is essential for hundreds of thousands of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost fans worldwide, followers of heavy metal history, and anyone who has ever wondered about the dark, artistic side of metal music. Without a doubt, Fischer is a singular figure responsible for untold innovation, and his book is sacred scripture for understanding the origins of underground heavy metal. He explains in intimately human terms how extreme metal was born, detailing the hardships and triumphs he faced bringing Hellhammer and Celtic Frost to reality.</p><h2>The Gray Rhino: How to Recognize and Act on the Obvious Dangers We Ignore</h2><p><p><b>The #1 English-language bestseller in China - the book that is shaping China's planning and policy for the future.</b></p><p>A "gray rhino" is a highly probable, high impact yet neglected threat: kin to both the elephant in the room and the improbable and unforeseeable black swan.

Is it a literal week or a series of time periods? If I believe that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, am I denying the authority of Scripture? In response to the continuing controversy over the interpretation of the creation narrative in Genesis, John Lennox proposes a succinct method of reading and interpreting the first chapters of Genesis without discounting either science or Scripture. With examples from history, a brief but thorough exploration of the major interpretations, and a look into the particular significance of the creation of human beings, Lennox suggests that Christians can heed modern scientific knowledge while staying faithful to the biblical narrative. He moves beyond a simple response to the controversy, insisting that Genesis teaches us far more about the God of Jesus Christ and about God s intention for creation than it does about the age of the earth. With this book, Lennox offers a careful yet accessible introduction to a scientifically-savvy, theologically-astute, and Scripturally faithful interpretation of Genesis.</p><p>John C.

In "Grace, Salvation, and Discipleship" you will find how to approach over 130 difficult Bible passages. Beginning with a clear understanding of God&#x2019;s grace and using a unique paradigm of &#x201c;A Truth, B Truth,&#x201d; you will discover from the context whether the passage is about salvation or the Christian life. In this book Dr. Charles Bing will help you to answer the questions: � Is becoming a Christian the same as becoming a disciple? � Do I have to work to earn or keep my salvation? � How many good works do I need to prove I am saved? � Can I be absolutely certain I am going to heaven? � How should I deal with doubts about my salvation? � How does sin affect my relationship with God? � How can I have a richer experience of God in this life and the next? A correct understanding of salvation and discipleship is crucial to understanding the Bible and growing in the Christian life. Only when we clearly understand what God says can we effectively share a clear gospel, be assured of our salvation, and grow in our relationship with Him. &#x201c;I have added it to my short list of recommended books on biblical difficulties.&#x201d; Norman L.

A New Path to the Waterfall was Carver&#39;s last book, and shows a writer telling the truth as best as he knows how in the time left to him. The sixty-odd poems in this collection are linked by Carver with selections from other writers, most notably Chekhov, whose work was an inspiration and a guide, and by the cumulative force of the life and death questions he poses in them. As Rilke&#39;s Letters to a Young Poet guided countless readers discovering their true love and work, Carver&#39;s book will guide those in the process of celebrating a limited life and mourning the inescapable end of it. A New Path to the Waterfall is an essential book for those who admire Carver&#39;s work, and testament to the transcendent strength of the human spirit. In her introductory essay, Tess Gallagher, Carver&#39;s companion and fellow writer, lays out the circumstances of their last years together with matter-of-fact grace.</p><p>After-glow<br> Another Mystery<br> Artaud<br> The Attic<br> Caution<br> Cherish<br> Conspirators<br> For The Record<br> Gravy<br> His Bathrobe Pockets Stuffed With Notes<br> Hummingbird (for Tess)<br> In A Greek Orthodox Church Near Daphne<br> The Kitchen<br> Late Fragment<br> Lemonade<br> Letter<br> Looking For Work (2)<br> The March Into Russia<br> Margo<br> The Moon, The Train<br> Mriacle<br> My Wife<br> The Net<br> No Need<br> The Offending Eel<br> On An Old Photograph Of My Son<br> One More<br> Out<br> The Painter &amp; The Fish<br> Poems<br> Proposal<br> Quiet Nights<br> The Sturgeon<br> Summer Fog<br> Sunday Night<br> Suspenders<br> Thermopylae<br> This Word Love<br> Threat<br> Through The Boughs<br> The Toes<br> Transformation<br> Two Worlds<br> Wake Up<br> What The Doctor Said<br> Wine<br> Woman Bathing<br> The World Book Salesman<br> The Young Girls<br> Return To Krakow In 1880<br> Wet Picture<br> The Name<br> -- <i>Table of Poems from Poem Finder�</i>Though Carver is generally acknowledged to be a master of the short story, his first published work was poetry, and this collection, his last work, was completed shortly before his untimely death. His poetry is as recognizably his own as his stories and like them evokes depths of meaning beneath a surface simplicity. In her moving introduction, Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, notes how often a particular poem calls to mind a corresponding story, and the reverse is also true. Indeed, to know Carver by his prose is to know him only partially. Master at illuminating those often mundane moments that starkly dramatize entire lives, Carver was also master at creating mood, and many of these poems have a striking lyrical intensity, especially when Carver unflinchingly faces death while celebrating life.

An important contribution to the contemporary renaissance in systematic theology!&#x201d; Timothy George Dean of Beeson Divinity School of Samford University, Executive Editor of Christianity Today As the Pentecostal/charismatic movement continues to grow, so does the need for solid theological resources for its members. While there are many volumes of systematic theology available, very few are written from a distinctly charismatic perspective. Truth Aflame seeks to meet that need. While academically sound, Truth Aflame is written with a practical, pastoral flavor. Larry Hart defines systematic theology as the process of taking what the Bible teaches and relating it to contemporary questions and knowledge. His passion for the subject is evident: he is concerned that the reader both grasps the magnificence of the study of God and allows these great truths to be transformative. This Truth, then&#x2014;liberating, enlivening, and transforming Truth&#x2014;becomes central to the ongoing renewal of the church that we are seeing in our day. Dr. Hart treats each of the traditional categories&#x2014;revelation, God, creation, humanity, sin, Christ, salvation, the church, and last things&#x2014;from a Pentecostal/charismatic perspective. He addresses other theological viewpoints but does not get bogged down in analysis and rebuttal. Further, he seeks to build bridges of understanding to those evangelicals outside the charismatic tradition. Clear, succinct, and readable, this revised and updated edition of Truth Aflame is well-suited not only for students, but for anyone desiring a greater understanding of Pentecostal/charismatic theology.</p></p><p>Larry Hart (PhD Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is Professor of theology in the School of Theology and Missions at Oral Roberts University, Tulsa, Oklahoma.1.

Select List of Confessions If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching [doctrine] that you have followed. ---1 Timothy 4:6 TNIV For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. ---2 Timothy 4:3 TNIV Why Didn&#39;t Someone Tell Me That I&#39;m a Theologian? A fine professional Presbyterian theologian once said that sex, politics, and theology were the only things worth talking about. Sex, he said, presents us with the question, &#39;Who am I?&#39; Politics asks, &#39;How can we learn to live together?&#39; But theology raises the ultimate questions about our origins, meaning, and destiny. Of the three topics, theology is the most interesting and important because it includes all the questions of the other two topics. &#39;The study of theology is by definition the quest for the ultimate truth about God, about ourselves and about the world we live in. What else is there to talk about?&#39;1 We unknowingly think about and discuss theology almost by the minute! Everyone is a theologian. If you have any opinions at all about what life is all about---what we humans are up to, what God (if you believe there is a God) is up to, and what is important in life---then you are a theologian. You have a theology whether you like it or not. Your theology is either well thought out and coherent, or it is hodgepodge and piecemeal. Even atheists are theologians! We sometimes think of theologians as professionals who specialize in esoteric, philosophical discussions about otherworldly matters that have little relevance to everyday life. Too often this idea appears accurate. In defense of the professionals, though, they have their rightful place in the scheme of things, along with specialists in other fields such as science and technology. The term theology can also have a bad name because there is so much bad theology out there. However, the answer to bad theology is not no theology, but good theology. What about the Bible? The other issue that arises when we mention theology is the Bible. Don&#39;t theologians enter into endless debate about the meanings of myriad biblical passages as they hammer out their positions (and sometimes the heads of their opponents!)? To be sure, the Bible has always played a major role in theological enterprise. Later we will evaluate what this role has been and should be. At this juncture, however, we will simply acknowledge the central role that the Bible has had for theological discussions both inside and outside the church. The big question is then, What is the Bible all about? Jack Rogers once said that he could summarize the basic message of the Bible in ten seconds: &#39;God made a good world and people messed it up; and God sent Jesus to put it and people back together.&#39;2 This statement raises a number of questions---all theological in nature. One such series of questions relates to the Bible itself: Why is the Bible so important anyway? How do we know whether its message is true? Can we be certain? Why do we accept the Bible as revelation? Theology texts address these and related issues in their prolegomena (prefatory) and methodology sections. Also, the nature of the Bible&#39;s role as revelation--- its authority, inspiration, trustworthiness, and so on---arises early on in almost any thorough doctrinal work. Rogers&#39;s statement raises further questions: Just who is this God who created the universe? Is the idea of a Creator God viable today in the face of the exploding body of scientific knowledge? What is the nature of the world that God made? What is the essential nature of humanity? What does it mean to be created male and female? (Now there&#39;s an interesting topic---and a profoundly theological one as well.) Rogers&#39;s reference to our &#39;messing things up&#39; brings up the concept of sin. This is perhaps the most offensive doctrine of all. Are we really all sinners? What exactly does this mean? Then mention is made of Jesus Christ. Who is Jesus Christ? What is his precise relationship to God? What was his mission? What did he do? Is he really God, as many say? Did he actually claim to be God? How does he &#39;put everything back together&#39;? Is he finished doing all this yet? Is he coming back to earth?</p><h2>The Youngest Science: Notes of a Medicine-Watcher (Alfred P.

Even Sante Fe's gorgeous desert setting fades against the blinding silliness of Woods's plotting here. A nifty premise sets up the story: Middle-aged film producer Wolf Willett, stranded at the Grand Canyon, opens a New York Times to read that his gorgeous young wife, Julia, his best pal, and...himself! have been shot dead at his Sante Fe home. But rather than run with that kick-off by having Wolf stay officially dead and investigate the murders incognito, Woods has his hero fly on to L.A.--and finish work on his latest movie. A week or so later, Wolf returns to Sante Fe and, anticipating legal trouble, hires legendary defense lawyer Ed Eagle--a 6'7'' tower of chutzpa who's the only character here who rises above clich&#x201a;. Under Ed's expensive guidance, Wolf manages temporarily to stave off arrest for triple-murder by the suspicious local cops, who finally figure out that the body misidentified as Wolf is really that of the sleazy ex-husband of Julia's nearly identical sister, Barbara--who shows up and begins a fling with Ed Eagle. Meanwhile, Wolf's psychiatrist is murdered. Finally arrested for the triple-slaying, Wolf is tossed into jail--and learns that Julia stole his $3.5 million savings just before she died. Fortunately, a former IRS agent retrieves Wolf's money, and, while in jail, Wolf is adopted by a biker named Spider, who, impressed that Wolf once shook hands with Madonna, offers help that proves invaluable after someone puts out a contract on Wolf--someone who looks a lot like Barbara/Julia.... All this cockeyed mayhem sorts out in the end, of course, as Woods winds up with this happy sentence starring Wolf's pet pooch: ``Flaps lifted her head and grinned at everybody''--a fitting conclusion to this shaggy-dog story of a novel, a shockingly poor showing from an author who's sometimes (e.g., Chiefs; Under the Lake) terrific. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

More than three thousand years ago, in the Bronze Age society of the Shang dynasty, the Spirits of Nature and of the Ancestors were regularly questioned and placated by Kings, their Shamans, and their Scribes, through Divination and Sacrifice. These Rituals were accompanied by music and dance, the consumption of fresh and dried meats and cereals, the drinking and libation of alcohol, and perhaps the ingestion of cannabis.1 The questions posed often concerned the Great Affairs of State. Should the King go to war? Was it going to rain (and would the crops be affected)? Should human prisoners or animals be sacrificed, to bring an end to the drought? Should the King go hunting for elephants? Was the harvest going to be a good one? Sometimes the questions were more personal. Was the King&#x2019;s toothache the result of an offense caused to an Ancestor? What was the significance of the King&#x2019;s dream? In order to elicit answers to such questions, the shoulder bone (scapula) of an ox or the undershell (plastron) of a turtle was ritually prepared and anointed with blood. Carefully placed indentations were made on it, and heat was applied to the indentations with a rod of some sort, producing cracks on the opposite surface. The cracks were then &#x201c;read&#x201d; as an oracular response.</p> <p>The bones and shells were often used several times, and were inscribed with the details of each Divination. They were stored in underground depositories, where they would lie forgotten for thousands of years. Occasionally a farmer might bring one or two to the surface with his plough. These Dragon Bones (as they were known) were ground into powder and used in traditional Chinese medicine. They were especially valued for the healing of wounds. It was only very recently&#x2014;in the last years of the nineteenth century&#x2014;that a number of scholars recognized their true nature and began avidly collecting them. The richest trove was discovered (not surprisingly) in and around the ancient Shang-dynasty capital at Anyang, in Henan Province. Since the first extensive excavations of the 1920s, hundreds of thousands of Oracle Bones have been unearthed, and numerous volumes reproducing the inscriptions have been published.2 Chinese and non-Chinese scholars have engaged in the complex and arduous process of deciphering and interpreting the documentation of this early form of communication with the Other World. Their writings have shed fresh and often startling light on the Shang dynasty, revealing a society greatly at variance with the Way of the Former Kings as it was idealized by sage-philosophers of a later time, such as Confucius. The Shang Priest-Kings seem to have been hugely preoccupied with Warfare and Sacrifice, and in particular with large-scale Human Sacrifice. It was a gruesome business. As the contemporary archaeologist Robert Bagley has coolly observed, &#x201c;Beheading was the normal method of Sacrifice, but some victims were dismembered or cut in half and a few children seem to have been trussed up and buried alive.&#x201d;3</p> <p>The powerful vassal state of Zhou from the western hinterlands finally conquered its eastern Shang neighbors toward the end of the second millennium BC, and founded its own dynasty. In the period that followed, the earlier shamanistic practices of Divination gradually lost ground to the more &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; or &#x201c;secular&#x201d; practice of achillomancy&#x2014;Yarrow Divination&#x2014;performed by casting the dried stalks of the yarrow, or milfoil, plant, <i>Achillea millefolium</i>.4 Mantic insight into the workings of the Universe and into the dynamic of a situation was provided by the casting of these Stalks.5 As a nobleman remarks in an entry for the year 644 BC in the early chronicle known as the <i>Zuo Commentary,</i> &#x201c;The Turtle gives Images; the Yarrow gives Numbers.&#x201d;6 At some point&#x2014;and here the story becomes obscure&#x2014;a body of traditional Divination lore seems to have been organized under a series of sixty-four diagrams, or Hexagrams, <i>gua</i>, each made up of six Divided (Broken) or Undivided (Unbroken) horizontal Lines. Traditionally the invention of these Hexagrams, or rather of the three-line Trigrams that were thought to constitute them, was ascribed to the legendary Fu Xi, divinely inspired by his observations of the Patterns of the Universe, of Nature, of Heaven and Earth. Some have speculated that it may have been the fall of the Yarrow Stalks themselves that gave rise to these patterns of Divided and Undivided Lines; others trace the Hexagrams back to early patterns scratched on the Oracle Bones.7 In any event, an oracular text, or &#x201c;book,&#x201d; became attached to the Hexagrams. This is as much as we can piece together of the hazy early story of the Oracle. There seem to have been several books of a similar nature. One (ours) was known as the <i>Zhouyi</i>, the <i>Change of Zhou</i>.8 In those days, it should be remembered, books were bundles of bamboo strips bound together with silk threads or leather thongs.</p> <p>There have been many different explanations for the term Change itself, today pronounced <i>yi</i>, in ancient days closer to <i>lek</i>. In the Oracle Bone Inscriptions it is used for a change in the weather: &#x201c;It will not rain, it will become [<i>change to</i>] overcast.&#x201d; &#x201c;Will it be [<i>change to</i>] an overcast day?&#x201d;9 Sometimes the change in the weather was the other way round, and the sun came out. But there seems to be no &#x201c;sun&#x201d; element in the early graph, which looks more like drops of water (rain or mist) beside the moon.</p> <p>As the American scholar Donald Harper has observed, there is simply too much that we do not know to permit a precise account of the development of the Hexagrams and of the evolution of the <i>Zhouyi</i> from Oracle to what I will refer to loosely as a Book of Wisdom, from achillomancy (Yarrow Divination) to bibliomancy (Divination by the Book known as the <i>Change of Zhou</i>).10 What is indisputable is that several of the early formulae used by the Diviners of the Shang era, as they occur in the surviving Inscriptions, are also found in the Bronze Age text of the Oracle. Richard Kunst has summarized this well: &#x201c;The divinatory lexicon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;took up in the late second millennium and early first millennium from where the Oracle Bone Inscriptions left off, then continued to develop through the years of the Zhou dynasty.&#x201d;11</p> <p>This Bronze Age text, which is the basis of Part II of my translation, seems to have gradually stabilized toward the middle of the dynasty (sometime between the ninth and sixth centuries BC). It was widely used by statesmen of the period, as we can read from several episodes in the <i>Zuo Commentary</i>. It was canonized as a classic, the <i>I Ching</i>, or the <i>Book [Classic] of Change</i>, in 136 BC, by which point it had already been provided with a series of commentaries.12 It has survived through the subsequent two thousand years of Chinese history, the strangest and most incomprehensible item in the Chinese canon, a text central to Confucian orthodoxy, and yet revered by Taoists and Buddhists; the &#x201c;first of the Confucian Classics&#x201d; and a pillar of state ideology, and yet at the same time a subtle and powerful vehicle for a wide range of heterodox ideas.</p> <p>The book we have today, then&#x2014;new editions of which, serious and not so serious, still appear with regularity in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong&#x2014;is the direct descendant of ancient Chinese Divination and Magic. Its core oracular text, the <i>Change of Zhou</i>, consisting of the Hexagrams themselves, the Hexagram Judgments, and the Statements attached to each Line, shares many of the preoccupations of Shang-dynasty Divination: the practice of Sacrifice, Ritual, and Warfare; the taking of captives; the activities of a pastoral society (herding, hunting, raising and gelding of livestock); sickness (its cause and cure); astronomical phenomena; and tinglings and other strange premonitions. Its language derives from the earliest known form of Chinese, used to record acts of Divination. If the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (and the later Inscriptions on Bronze Ritual Vessels) are the Chinese language in the making, the <i>Change of Zhou</i> is one of the earliest attempts to put that language to a coherent purpose.</p> <p>In addition to divinatory formulae such as &#x201c;It is Auspicious,&#x201d; &#x201c;A Sacrifice was Received,&#x201d; &#x201c;Supreme Fortune,&#x201d; and &#x201c;No Harm,&#x201d; the early Oracle incorporated a patchwork of other popular oral materials&#x2014;fragments of ancestral legend and myth, proverbs, songs, and rhymes&#x2014;which became attached to a cyclical structure, the series of Sixty-Four Hexagrams. Joseph Needham, the great historian of Chinese science and thought, hazarded a guess as to the process whereby this took place: &#x201c;First there were the collections of ancient peasant-omens (about birds, insects, weather, subjective feelings, and the like).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<i>Somehow or other these collections coalesced</i> [my italics] with the books of the professional Diviners, books which preserved traditional lore relating to scapulimancy, Divination by the milfoil sticks [Yarrow Stalks], and other forms of prognostication.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They remodelled the text and added elaborate commentaries on it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;13 Each of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams in the series acquired a Name. The Names were not initially fixed, but varied from one version of the Oracle to another, as did their sequential order and the wording of the text itself&#x2014;we can see this in the old bamboo-strip or silk transcriptions that have been excavated recently. But the wordless diagrams provided a crystalline structure to which the fluctuating text adhered.14 However the Hexagrams and their related texts themselves may have evolved, at this early stage in its history the words of the Oracle were linked to no system of ideas, to no Confucian or Taoist philosophy or Yin-Yang cosmology. In other words, the early oracular <i>Change of Zhou</i> was not yet a Book of Wisdom. It provided its readers (the kings and aristocrats who consulted it) with glimpses (often puzzling ones) of the workings of the Universe and man&#x2019;s part in it, glimpses descended from the ancient shamanistic dialogue with the unknown. With time these glimpses were to be interpreted in terms of a holistic vision of the Universe, a vision contained in many of the <i>I Ching</i> commentaries, a vision associated with the central word Tao.15 Richard Lynn has summarized this evolution well: &#x201c;Hexagram Divination&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;changed from a method of consulting and influencing Gods, Spirits and Ancestors&#x2014;the &#x2018;powerful dead&#x2019;&#x2014;to a method of penetrating moments of the cosmic order to learn how the Way, or Tao, is configured and what direction it takes at such moments and to determine what one&#x2019;s place is and should be in the scheme of things.&#x201d;16 Both Oracle and Book of Wisdom put the reader in touch with a greater scheme of things, opening a door to a &#x201c;larger view&#x201d; of the world.17</p> <p><b>FROM ORACLE TO BOOK OF WISDOM</b></p> <p>During the two periods of Zhou dynastic decline known as the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States, the text circulated in this early oracular form among the states contending for leadership of the realm and was consulted for advice on pressing matters of state, and sometimes on lesser issues. When the draconian Qin state united the empire, it was one of the few texts to escape the &#x201c;burning of the books&#x201d; (in 213 BC), surviving intact, so tradition has it, precisely because it was regarded not as a work of philosophy (and therefore a potential source of dissidence) but &#x201c;merely&#x201d; as a useful handbook of Divination.18 A growing apparatus of quasi-philosophical commentaries was nonetheless already growing up around the urtext of the Oracle. These, known collectively as the Ten Wings and probably dating from the third and second centuries BC, were for many centuries attributed to more or less legendary figures. The Great Treatise (<i>Dazhuan</i>), perhaps the most important of these early commentaries, places the origins of the Trigrams in the remote past, setting the superlative tone adopted by many subsequent commentators.</p> <p></p> <p>Of old, when Fu Xi ruled the world,</p> <p>He gazed upward and observed</p> <p>Images in the Heavens;</p> <p>He gazed about him and observed</p> <p>Patterns upon the Earth.</p> <p>He observed markings on birds and beasts,</p> <p>How they were adapted to different regions.</p> <p>Close at hand, he drew inspiration from within his own person;</p> <p>Further afield, he drew inspiration from the outside world.</p> <p>Thus he created the Eight Trigrams,</p> <p>He made Connection with the Power of Spirit Light,</p> <p>He distinguished the Myriad Things according to their Essential Nature.19</p> <p></p> <p>In a sense, it almost did not matter to whom the Trigrams, the Hexagrams, or the words attached to them were ascribed. In the eloquent words of the American scholar Kidder Smith, the <i>I Ching</i> was &#x201c;the consummate written text, in that nearly every trace of human actors is absent from it. Its language is in this sense disembodied, and, by the same measure, empowered to roam freely throughout the natural world. It is in this sense <i>shen</i>, a &#x2018;spirit&#x2019; or &#x2018;spiritual,&#x2019; a text less of culture than of Heaven-and-Earth, of Nature.&#x201d;20 It continued to occupy this central spiritual space, as Book of Wisdom and Power, for over two thousand years. The central <i>I Ching</i> concepts, Yin and Yang, the Tao, Good Faith, and Self-Cultivation, have preoccupied almost every Chinese thinker until the twentieth century.21 To read or quote from the <i>I Ching</i> is to touch the very spiritual heart of things Chinese. Its &#x201c;quality of mysterious holiness,&#x201d; to quote the American scholar Michael Nylan, &#x201c;has engaged nearly every major thinker in imperial China.&#x201d;22 The influential Song-dynasty philosopher Zhou Dunyi considered it to be <i>the</i> Spiritual Book par excellence, &#x201c;the mysterious home of the gods of Heaven and Earth.&#x201d;23 In 1271, the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan, at the suggestion of a Chinese adviser, named his Chinese dynasty &#x201c;Yuan,&#x201d; from the opening word of the Judgment for Hexagram I: <i>yuan</i>, Supreme or Primordial.24</p> <p><b>The Classic and Its Many Commentaries</b></p> <p>The Ten Wings were the first of many attempts to weave a more sophisticated web of ideas around the basic Oracle, adapting the mantic tradition of the Hexagrams to a philosophical or cosmological scheme. They became an inseparable part of the classic.25 The layers of text and commentary (and their traditional attributions) are best shown in tabular form.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Layers of Text</b></p> <p><b>The Core Oracular Text</b></p> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;The Eight Trigrams ( <i>Ba gua</i>) and the Sixty-Four Hexagrams ( <i>Liushisi gua</i>), attributed to Fu Xi. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;The Hexagram Judgments ( <i>Tuan</i>), attributed to King Wen, founder of the Zhou dynasty. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;The Line Statements ( <i>Yaoci</i>), attributed to the Duke of Zhou, King Wen&#x2019;s son, regent for the second Zhou king. <p><b>The Ten Wings (Early Commentaries)</b></p> <p></p> <p><i>Wings 1&#x2013;2</i></p> <p>On the Judgment (<i>Tuanzhuan</i>).

The Bruised Reed is a book by Richard Sibbes that comforts the despondent and fearful Christian using the words of Matthew 12:20 (which quotes Isaiah), "A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out." Many Christians have found this book to be remedy to doubt and burden.</p><p> </p><p>This exposition breaks down into three basic parts: (1) Christ will not break the bruised reed; (2) Christ will not quench the smoking flax; (3) Christ will not do either of these things until he has sent forth judgment into victory. Sibbes explains the main text under these three headings and then intersperses searching application throughout the book. In this book powerfully written book the Puritan preacher provides a tenderhearted, Christ-exalting exposition and application of Isaiah 42:1-3. Since its initial publication in 1630, The Bruised Reed has been a source of encouragement to people at every stage of their spiritual journey alike; regardless if you are searching for God, just starting a relationship with Him, striving in your relationship with God or surrendered to God and His will; this book can be helpful for you.</p></p><p><p>'I shall never cease to be grateful to...Richard Sibbes who was balm to my soul at a period in my life when I was overworked and badly overtired, and therefore subject in an unusual manner to the onslaughts of the devil...I found at that time that Richard Sibbes, who was known in London in the early seventeenth century as "The Heavenly Doctor Sibbes" was an unfailing remedy...The Bruised Reed.. quieted, soothed, comforted, encouraged and healed me.' --<em>D.

But in order to live a more satisfying life experience, one must heal the wounds of the past, so that the connection to Self can be made. Once the wounds have healed, and the minds chatter has eased, loving the Self then becomes possible. All love starts with Self-love.</p><p><i>If you have recently been struck with the news by a therapist that you or your relationship is "codependent" you may be asking yourself "What the hell does that mean?" And if neither you nor your partner is an alcoholic or has any known addiction, you may not be clear as to what it means to be told you are suffering from codependency.</i><i>As my life began to unravel before my very eyes, I often times felt shear panic over what to do next. &nbsp;I had lived my life under the impression that I was doing everything right. &nbsp;What I did not realize was, I was also trying to control everything and everyone in my experience. &nbsp;When my husband didn't do what I thought he should do, I became angry, sad, depressed and often times blamed him for why I felt so overwhelmed. &nbsp;And it wasn't just him I seemed to have issues with. &nbsp;In my mind, I was right--about everything--and everyone else was wrong. &nbsp;And then I heard the words, "Lisa you're not crazy--but you are codependent," and I understood that perhaps--just maybe I needed to start looking at what I may have been doing wrong--instead of focusing on others.</i><i> When my marriage fell apart and I found myself suddenly alone, and responsible for my three young children, there were many moments when I felt as if negative self talk was going to gobble me up. &nbsp;Depression was so thick, sometimes I wondered how it was I was ever going to face another day. &nbsp;Constant self battery was the norm. &nbsp;Once I did not know about this thing called Self Awareness. &nbsp;</i><i>When we are unconscious to why our lives are not working, we often think other people are the reasons why we are so unhappy. &nbsp;We are confused because we keep attracting partners, friends and acquaintances that abuse us, or take advantage of us. &nbsp;We are unaware that our subconscious ideas about Self are the reasons we keep attracting people into our lives that cannot support us emotionally or otherwise. &nbsp;We hear ourselves yearning for a healthy relationship, yet are deaf to the unconscious wounds that shout, "I am not enough--I am not deserving". Until these ideas are brought to the conscious mind where they can be observed, and ultimately dealt with appropriately, Self neglect and abuse continues. &nbsp;</i><i>Affirmations helped me heal my once tattered life, and they can and will do the same for you. </i><i></i><i>These affirmations helped me stay focused on 'me' and what was going on inside 'my head' so that I could teach myself how to 'detach' and finally take responsibility for my 'own happiness'. &nbsp;It wasn't an easy thing; to heal my codependent mind, but heal I have, and happy I am.</i><i></i><i>May these affirmations be just the dose of self help medicine you need to keep you focused <b>on the road back to you.&nbsp;</b></i>Lisa A.

What is Canada? What makes up this diverse, complex, and often contested nation-state? What was its founding moment? And who are its people? Drawing on her many years of experience as a scholar, writer, and teacher of Canadian history, Conrad offers astute answers to these difficult questions. Beginning in Canada&#39;s deep past with the arrival of its Aboriginal peoples, she traces its history through the conquest by Europeans, the American Revolutionary War, and the industrialization of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to its prosperous present. As a social historian, Conrad emphasizes the peoples&#39; history: the relationships between Aboriginal and settler, the French and the English, the Catholic and Protestant, and the rich and poor. She writes of the impact of disease, how women fared in the early colonies, and of the social transformations that took place after the Second World War as Canada began to assert itself as an independent nation. It is this grounded approach which drives the narrative and makes for compelling reading. In the last chapter, the author explains the social, economic, and political upheavals that have transformed the nation over the last three decades. Despite its successes and its popularity as a destination for immigrants from across the world, Canada remains a curiously reluctant player on the international stage. This intelligent, concise, and lucid book explains just why that is.</p><p>Margaret Conrad&#39;s history of Canada begins with a challenge to its readers. What is Canada?

She was the tenth of thirteen children, and her mother experienced no pain at her birth. Though exquisitely beautiful (hence her nickname, Rose), she refused to marry, and while helping support her family by needlework and growing flowers, she practiced heroic charity and lived as a Dominican Tertiary in her parents&#x2019; home. Rose tenderly cared for the sick, even those with repulsive wounds, and she often obtained miraculous cures for people from the Child Jesus. <br> <br> On other occasions, she worked miracles in order to feed the members of her family, and became known as &#x201c;Mother of the Poor.&#x201d; Rose continually prayed and offered her sufferings for the conversion of the idolatrous Incas. In the year 1615, through her prayers, the Blessed Sacrament and the people of Lima were spared attack by savage pirates. St. Rose was a friend and confidant of St. Martin de Porres, who lived in the same city. Her mystical experiences caused an ecclesiastical inquiry.<br><br>Though dead at only 31, St. Rose&#x2019;s love of God was so intense that she was recognized as a saint in her own time and was canonized by the Church just 54 years later, in 1671. St. Rose of Lima has captured the imagination of the world and stands as one of the most popular saints in the history of the Church.</p><p>Sister Mary Alphonsus, O.SS.R., was a nun and author of the twentieth century. Her biography of <i>St. Rose of Lima: Patroness of the Americas</i> relates the tale of a humble, young, poor girl who gave her life to God rather than to the many suitors who eagerly pursued her. Sister Alphonsus' work was originally published in 1968 by the B. Herder Book Company, receiving the Imprimatur upon publication. It was also printed by TAN in 2010.</p><h2>Breathing Room: Open Your Heart by Decluttering Your Home</h2><p>Cleaning out your cupboards isn&#x2019;t just about a tidier kitchen.

Many of us have gone through bad church experiences that have left us feeling like failures. Blaming ourselves, we asked for God's forgiveness, but felt distant from the church and sometimes from God too. Often, however, the fault is not ours but that of Christian leaders who abuse spiritually. How can we recognize the signs of spiritual abuse? What can we do to gain healing from the wounds we have experienced? With clarity and refreshing honesty, Ken Blue answers these questions and offers hope and healing to the victims of spiritual abuse. In addition he shows Christian leaders how to avoid abusive patterns and instead offer Christ's gospel of grace to every casualty of bad church experiences.</p><p>Ken Blue is the director of Good News to the Poor, an organization that takes the gospel and business training to the developing world.</p><h2>Acts (The IVP New Testament Commentary Series, Volume 5)</h2><p>If ever there was an environment hostile to the gospel, it was the strife-torn, ethnically diverse backwater of the Roman Empire known as Palestine following the ascension of Jesus. But the gospel thrived--beginning from Jerusalem and spreading throughout Judea, Samaria and the rest of the known world. In Acts, the sequel to his Gospel, Luke tells how the Holy Spirit transformed a ragtag band of believers into a unified, world-engaging church. And as William Larkin explores this narrative of the early church, he offers inspiration and insight for readers who wonder how the gospel may be advanced in the increasingly divided and skeptical culture of the late twentieth century. In this clear, incisive commentary, readers will find an introduction with background material concerning authorship, date and purpose, as well as a summary of important theological themes. A passage-by-passage exposition follows that focuses on understanding what significance Acts had for its original readers in order to see its relevance for the church today. Students, pastors, Bible teachers and everyone who wants to understand the message of Acts for the church will benefit from this excellent resource.</p><p><strong>William J. Larkin Jr.</strong> (Ph.D., University of Durham) is professor of biblical studies at Columbia International University Seminary and School of Ministry in Columbia, South Carolina.

Nine months later, LeMond lay in a hospital bed, his life in peril after a hunting accident, his career as a bicycle racer seemingly over. And yet, barely two years after this crisis, LeMond mounted a comeback almost without parallel in professional sports. In summer 1989, he again won the Tour&#x2015;arguably the world&#x2019;s most grueling athletic contest&#x2015;by the almost impossibly narrow margin of 8 seconds over another French legend, Laurent Fignon. It remains the closest Tour de France in history.<br> <br> <i>The Comeback</i> chronicles the life of one of America&#x2019;s greatest athletes, from his roots in Nevada and California to the heights of global fame, to a falling out with his own family and a calamitous confrontation with Lance Armstrong over allegations the latter was doping&#x2015;a campaign LeMond would wage on principle for more than a decade before Armstrong was finally stripped of his own Tour titles. With the kind of narrative drive that propels books like <i>Moneyball</i>, and a fierce attention to detail, Daniel de Vis� reveals the dramatic, ultra-competitive inner world of a sport rarely glimpsed up close, and builds a compelling case for LeMond as its great American hero.</p><p><b>Daniel de Vis�</b> is an author and journalist. A graduate of Wesleyan and Northwestern universities, he has worked at the <i>Washington Post</i> and <i>Miami Herald</i>, among other newspapers. He shared a 2001 Pulitzer Prize and has garnered more than two dozen national and regional journalism awards. He is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Andy and Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show</i> and coauthor of <i>I Forgot To Remember: A Memoir of Amnesia</i>. He lives in Maryland with his wife and children.On a small patch of unoccupied blacktop in a crowded plaza near the grand palace of Versailles, two riders pedaled bicycles in a warm-up exercise around a tiny oval, riding counterclockwise at opposite poles, like horses on a carousel. Their eyes never met. The two figures were almost mirror images&#x2015;blond-haired, muscular and taut. After twenty days and three thousand kilometers of racing, Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon were fifty seconds apart in the standings of the 1989 Tour de France. They had traded savage attacks over the three previous weeks, neither man ever leading the other by more than mere seconds. The lead had changed hands three times. Greg had worn the <i>maillot jaune</i>, the race leader&#x2019;s yellow jersey, for seven days; Laurent had worn it for nine. Now, the jersey hung on Laurent&#x2019;s back. Greg sat in second place. By day&#x2019;s end, the Tour would be decided. And no matter who won, this would likely be the closest finish in the seventy-six-year history of <i>le Tour</i>.<br> <br> On this July afternoon, the circling cyclists readied for a final twenty-five-kilometer dash downhill from the royal ch�teau to the finish line on the Champs-�lys�es in Paris. This was the time trial, cycling&#x2019;s Race of Truth, in French the <i>contre la montre</i>&#x2015;literally, &#x201c;against the watch.&#x201d; Savvy observers had surveyed the course and reckoned a middling rider could complete it in about twenty-nine minutes. A great one might win it in twenty-eight. Greg needed to reclaim those fifty seconds from his French rival on this final day of racing, to pull back two seconds for every kilometer raced, in order to win the Tour. <br> <br> Both Greg and Laurent were men of twenty-eight&#x2015;young adults in the broad scheme of life, yet aging journeymen in the brief and brutal career of cycling. Each had conquered <i>le Tour</i> before, Laurent in 1983 and 1984, Greg in 1986, each, in turn, enjoying a brief reign atop the precarious pecking order of professional cycling. Then each cyclist had abruptly lost his &#x201c;form,&#x201d; a term invoked by cycling writers to describe a rider at his peak. Both had dwelt for years in cycling&#x2019;s wilderness, missing races, abandoning them, or finishing at the back of the pack. Now, at the signature event of the 1989 cycling season, each man had miraculously recovered his form. Greg and Laurent were back on top&#x2015;both of them, at exactly the same time, a most inconvenient coincidence. Neither knew how long the second wind might last. If there was to be another victory at the Tour for either of them, the time was now.<br> <br> As the clock wound down to Greg&#x2019;s 4:12 p.m. start, television commentators interviewed cycling experts and one another, all asking the same question: Could LeMond catch Fignon?<br> <br> &#x201c;It will be close,&#x201d; predicted Paul Sherwen, a former professional cyclist turned broadcaster, speaking on the live ITV transmission in Britain. &#x201c;But I think, logically, it&#x2019;s got to be Fignon.&#x201d;</p><h2>In Siberia</h2><p><p>As mysterious as its beautiful, as forbidding as it is populated with warm-hearted people, Syberia is a land few Westerners know, and even fewer will ever visit. Traveling alone, by train, boat, car, and on foot, Colin Thubron traversed this vast territory, talking to everyone he encountered about the state of the beauty, whose natural resources have been savagely exploited for decades; a terrain tainted by nuclear waste but filled with citizens who both welcomed him and fed him&#x2014;despite their own tragic poverty. From Mongoloia to the Artic Circle, from Rasputin's village in the west through tundra, taiga, mountains, lakes, rivers, and finally to a derelict Jewish community in the country's far eastern reaches, Colin Thubron penetrates a little-understood part of the world in a way that no writer ever has.</p></p><p><i>In Siberia</i> explores a region of astonishments, where "white cranes dance on the permafrost, where a great city floats lost among the ice floes, where mammoths sleep under glaciers." Colin Thubron's latest chronicle also delivers its subject from rumor into reality. An expanse larger than the entire United States, Siberia is undoubtedly a country of contrasts, which elicits from the author both awe and melancholy. Here on one hand is a northern wilderness "shattered into a jigsaw of ponds and streams," and on the other a "black detritus of factories and ruins." No less memorable than the landscape are the people that Thubron encounters. He gathers their stories like rough jewels, showing us a self-proclaimed descendant of Rasputin, an isolated Jewish community, and a parade of "indestructible babushkas." <p> Woven among the often bitter and eroding memories of a Siberian past is a sense of new freedom. After all, this is the first time in Russia's history when foreigners can travel freely throughout the region--and its inhabitants can comment openly about their government without fear of reprisal. Thubron coaxes an institute official at the Akademgorodok Praesidium to speak his mind: </p><blockquote> His face was heavy with anger. "We have one overriding problem here. <i>Money</i>. We receive no money for new equipment, hardly enough for our salaries. There are people who haven't been paid for six months." Then his anger overflowed. He was barking like a drill sergeant. "This year we requested funds for six or seven different programmes! And not one has been accepted by the government! Not one!" </blockquote><p> Thubron's portrait is as elegant as it is evocative. But just as notably, his journey to the east manages to break the long and destructive Siberian silence. <i>--Byron Ricks</i></p><p>Colin Thubron is the author of seven award-winning novels, including <em>To the Last City</em>, which was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize.

In these lectures, scores, and writings, Cage tries, as he says, to find a way of writing that comes from ideas, is not about them, but that produces them. Often these writings include mesostics and essays created by subjecting the work of other writers to chance procedures using the I Ching. Fifty years later comes a beautiful new edition with a foreword by eminent music critic Kyle Gann. A landmark book in American arts and culture, Silence has been translated into more than forty languages and has sold over half a million copies worldwide. Wesleyan University Press is proud to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the book&#x2019;s publication with this special edition.</p><p>7 x 8 1/4 trim.

A pioneer of percussion, chance, and electronic music, Cage was one of the most influential American composers of the twentieth century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance in America, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham. Cage is perhaps best known for his 1952 composition 4'33", the three movements of which are performed without a single note being played.

To learn more, visit JenniferChiaverini.com.In a move that may frustrate fans, the eighth episode of Chiaverini's best-selling Elm Creek Quilts series (after The Sugar Camp Quilt) focuses on a roster of new quilting talent, as the rural Pennsylvania quilting retreat loses two of its charmed teachers. Each of the five candidates gets her or his own chapter; they begin variously-Maggie's first quilting find, a busy day for harried mom Karen, chef Anna's panic over a last-minute catering gig, Russ meeting his future wife, a morning argument between Gretchen and her husband-but they all end at Elm Creek Quilts, in an interview with the series's lead characters. Though the pleasures of the novel are many-well-drawn characters, cleverly intersecting plotlines, and Chiaverini's charming sense of humor among them-these may be cold comfort for those eager to find out the latest on Sarah McClure, Sylvia Compson and the rest of the gang, who take on greatly diminished roles. Also potentially maddening: the identity of the two quitting quilters isn't revealed until the end of the book. For new readers, a pedestrian pace and sentimental locale may prove off-putting, but for those with the taste for it, this is a great introduction to the Elm Creek world. It also sets up the coming volumes nicely, bringing fresh blood and new opportunities for drama to this sweet, escapist series.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But their love of the game, and their desire to play could not be denied. Despite that ban, &#34;blackball&#34; was being played in just about every cow pasture and field available throughout the country. Black players criss-crossed the country in Negro League games and on barnstorming tours, bringing baseball to places where the Major Leagues never dreamed of going. Many gifted athletes never got the chance to compete in the Majors, until the door was finally opened in 1947 with the signing of Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby. Once given that chance to compete, African-Americans showed the country that they were deserving of the opportunity. Many became superstars, but, on the mound, only 13 African-Americans ever reached the magic plateau of twenty wins in a season. This book tells the story of those thirteen men and a few of their predecessors, the obstacles they faced, and the determination they showed to succeed. But it is a story about so much more than just baseball. Against the backdrop of their grit and determination, it reflects the story of all African-American baseball players through the creation of the Negro Leagues, the evolution of the game, and the parallel integration of baseball and America.</p><p></p><h2>Gilgamesh Retold (Carcanet Classics)</h2><p>Jenny Lewis relocates <i>Gilgamesh </i>to its earlier, oral roots in a Sumerian society where men and women were more equal, the reigning deity of Gilgamesh&#x2019;s city, Uruk, was female (Inanna), only women were allowed to brew beer and keep taverns and women had their own language&#x2014;emesal.

Given this history, some might be tempted to ignore the theology of creation, thinking it has nothing new or substantive to say. They would be wrong.</p><p>In this stimulating volume, Ian A. McFarland shows that at the heart of the doctrine of creation lies an essential truth about humanity: we are completely dependent on God. Apart from this realization, little else about us makes sense.</p><p>McFarland demonstrates that this radical dependence is a consequence of the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, creation from nothing. Taking up the theological consequences of creation--theodicy and Providence--the author provides a detailed and innovative constructive theology of creation. Drawing on the biblical text, classical sources, and contemporary thought, From Nothing proves that a robust theology of creation is a necessary correlate to the Christian confession of redemption in Jesus Christ.</p></p><p>Ian A. McFarland is Associate Dean of Faculty and Academic Affairs and Professor of Theology at Candler School of Theology, Emory University. He is the author of several books, including <i>In Adam's Fall: A Meditation on the Christian Doctrine of Original Sin</i> and <i>The Divine Image: Envisioning the Invisible God</i>."Acknowledging forthrightly both the exegetical and philosophical problems posed by the church's doctrine of creation from nothing, this well researched and cogently argued study makes an impressive case for why faith in the trustworthiness of the triune God who creates all things in Christ may be shown to provide a deeper understanding of what creation entails than either its ancient or recent alternatives. Once again McFarland has demonstrated how a first rate critical engagement with the sources of Christian doctrinal traditions can constructively address some of today's most vital issues." --Christopher Morse, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Professor Emeritus of Theology and Ethics, Union Theological Seminary, New York<br><br>"This is a masterful account of God <i>as</i> creator, the world <i>as</i> creation, and how the <i>'as'</i> in each case shapes how to live both in God and in the world. This is 'doctrine of creation,' not from the perspective of a defensive crouch before scientific skepticism on one side or 'rational design' on the other, but from the perspective of the fundamental importance of the idea of creation for faithful living and thinking. God creates from nothing; Ian McFarland constructs theology of creation out of a rich mix of conversations with Scripture, the history of Christian thought, debates about science and theology, and an ecumenical chorus of theological voices. McFarland's superb theological craftsmanship always keeps the book clear, engaging, and wonderfully illuminating." --David H. Kelsey, Luther Weigle Professor Emeritus of Theology, Yale Divinity School<br><br>"Ian McFarland has produced one of the most substantial contributions in recent times to the theology of creation. Rooted in Scripture and church tradition, yet always alert to contemporary challenges, his study offers an important defense of the classical ex nihilo doctrine. By describing its vital function for Christian thought and action, he shows how it is not a quasi-scientific hypothesis but an essential part of an account of the ways in which all creatures are sustained and loved by God." --David Fergusson, Professor of Divinity and Principal of New College, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"McFarland's monograph is arguably the most serious retrieval of the doctrine of creation <i>ex nihilo</i> in recent systematic theology. He successfully dispels the accusation that the doctrine necessarily implies an arbitrary God, and convincingly argues, through christological refocusing, that this key affirmation of Christian faith proclaims how the Creator is 'not only inexhaustibly rich in God's self, but also endlessly profligate in sharing this divine plenitude with creatures.' Through careful rereading of biblical texts and lively conversation with patristic and other sources from the Christian tradition, we are treated to a fresh and incisive analysis of divine transcendence, freedom, providence, and love for the contingent, created 'other.' McFarland furthermore tackles a wide array of philosophical and theological challenges facing the doctrine of creation in modern and postmodern thought, and will thus stimulate many conversations of its own in areas as diverse as ecological theology, sacramentology, and theological aesthetics, to name a few." --Paul M. Blowers, Author of <i>Drama of the Divine Economy: Creator and Creation in Early Christian Theology and Piety</i> (Oxford, 2012)<br><br></p><h2>Seasons</h2><p><p>In this graphically stunning picture book, Blexbolex explores the cyclical nature of time by looking at the seasons.

Born white and poor in New England, Eunice moved from countryside to factory city, worked in the mills, then followed her husband to the Deep South. When the Civil War came, Eunice's brothers joined the Union army while her husband fought and died for the Confederacy. Back in New England, a widow and the mother of two, Eunice barely got by as a washerwoman, struggling with crushing depression. Four years later, she fell in love with a black sea captain, married him, and moved to his home in the West Indies. Following every lead in a collection of 500 family letters, Hodes traced Eunice's footsteps and met descendants along the way. This story of misfortune and defiance takes up grand themes of American history&#x2015;opportunity and racism, war and freedom&#x2015;and illuminates the lives of ordinary people in the past.</p><p>A <em>Library Journal</em> Best Book of the Year and a selection of the Book of the Month Club, Literary Guild, and Quality Paperback Book Club.</p> 47 illustrations</p><p>Martha Hodes, a professor of history at New York University, is the author of White Women, Black Men, which won the Allan Nevins Prize for Literary Distinction. She lives in New York City and Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.Hodes reconstructs the intriguing and unusual life of Eunice Richardson Stone Connolly. a mill laborer in mid&#x2013;19th-century New England who went South with her husband to seek their fortune; homesick, even as her husband fought for the Confederacy, she returned to New Hampshire, where she was reduced to working as a washerwoman. The only thing that brought an impoverished Eunice respectability was her white skin. But then she heard of her husband's death, and in 1869, mystifying some of her relatives, Connolly put that respectability at risk, too, marrying a well-to-do black sea captain from Grand Cayman Island and moving there with him. Hodes, a historian at NYU (<i>White Women, Black Men: Illicit Sex in the Nineteenth-Century South</i>), relies on a rich cache of Connolly's letters, which are housed at Duke University. Unfortunately, the letters don't reveal how Connolly met her second husband or explain in depth why she decided to marry him. Hodes's prose, though sometimes a bit affected ("In place of fiction, I offer the craft of history, assisted by the art of speculation"), is lucid and her account is engaging, though for readers steeped in the subject not pathbreaking; what Hodes has to tell us about the 19th century&#x2014;that race was socially constructed and complicated, for example&#x2014;is nothing new. 47 b&amp;w illus., 2 maps. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gang Member</i> exploded on the scene and gave us all a front row seat to explore the genocidal brutality of the neo-colonial world of gangbanging. A world that exists at the expense of New Afrikan communities and New Afrikan youth in particular, through our social savage way of attempting to gain power through AKs, bats and beat downs ... it was in the belly of the beast (prison) that 'Monster' underwent a revolutionary transformation, dissecting and re-building himself from the inside out, slaying the colonial thug Monster and emerging through a re-birth as 'Sanyika Shakur,' a New Afrikan Revolutionary Nationalist." - from the Foreword by Yusef "Bunchy" Shakur<br><br> This collection of writings by Sanyika Shakur, formerly known as Monster Kody Scott, includes several essays written from within the infamous Pelican Bay Security Housing Unit in the period around the historic 2011 California prisoners' hunger strike, as well as two interviews conducted just before and after his release in Black August 2012. <br><br> Shakur rejects the easy answers and false solutions of the neocolonial age - integration and racism, the colonial-criminal mentality and subservience to imperialism as the "oppo-sames" that they are. Firmly rooted in the New Afrikan Communist tradition, he skillfully uses the tools of dialectical materialism to lay bare the deeper connections between racism, sexism, and homophobia and how these mental diseases relate to the ongoing capitalist (neo-)colonial catastrophe we remain trapped within. <br><br> Defending the legacy of New Afrikans' historic struggle for Land, Independence, and Socialism, Shakur spells out a uniquely liberatory Revolutionary Nationalist vision. Annihilating the "amerikan" mental fog that has new generations continuing to self-defeat rather than coming together against the real enemy, Stand Up, Struggle Forward serves as a battle cry against all forms of oppression. <br><br> Stand Up, Struggle Forward also contains a valuable account of political repression in the California prison system, including several of the intelligence memoranda they were used to condemn Shakur to years of solitary confinement in Pelican Bay. These internal prison documents clearly show that this prolonged solitary confinement was a direct result of Shakur's continuing promotion of New Afrikan Revolutionary Nationalist politics. As such, they provide a clear example of the way in which solitary confinement continues to be used as a tool of political repression against thousands of prisoners in California today.</p><p>Sanyika Shakur is also the author of the widely acclaimed book <i>Monster: The Autobiography of an L.A.

It follows him through difficult years at school, his early love affairs, his intellectual quests, his entrepreneurial pursuits, and his intense search for spiritual meaning.

After sixty-one years as head of the Commonwealth&#x2014;the association of fifty-three nations formerly constituting the British Empire&#x2014;she had deputed her eldest son to represent her at the biennial meeting of the Commonwealth leaders in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in November 2013. Opening its summit had been one of her most cherished duties.<br> Acting on behalf of the monarch for the first time in this particular capacity was highly significant, the start of an unofficial transitional period. The Queen had already begun trimming her schedule as a concession to her advancing age. The occasion was something of a harmonic convergence as well. The previous day Prince Charles had celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday&#x2014;retirement, for most people. He was now the oldest heir to the throne in three hundred years.<br> I had decided to make the long trip to this event because I sensed its importance as a turning point in a life with many unforeseen&nbsp;twists. It had been more than twenty years since I first met the Prince of Wales socially, at a polo match in Windsor on a rainy June afternoon in 1991, when he was forty-two. An avid player, he had been sidelined because of back pain, and afterward he joined my group, which included seventy-four-year-old Zara Cazalet, a close friend of his adored grandmother, the Queen Mother. &#x201c;Zara!&#x201d; he exclaimed, giving her a big kiss on the cheek. I was struck by how comfortable he was with an older woman, how affectionate and attentive he was to her. Contrary to his image as a fogey, he was surprisingly informal in his blue blazer and tan trousers and far warmer than his aloof portrayal in the tabloid press.&nbsp;<br> Eight years later, just as I was finishing a biography of Diana, Princess of Wales, I came across Charles at another polo match, a benefit for one of his charities. He surprised me again that day at the Cirencester Park Polo Club. Under the tent at the post-match reception, well-heeled country gentry waited expectantly to meet him. They had paid for the privilege, and he complied&#x2014;up to a point. But he chose to spend most of his time talking to a young woman who received the check on behalf of his inner-city charity, showing an empathetic side of his character, along with an independent spirit. My view of him expanded a decade later when I wrote a biography of Queen Elizabeth II that was published in 2012 during her Diamond Jubilee marking sixty years on the throne. Although the focus of my research was the life of Charles&#x2019;s mother, I attended seven private dinners for the Prince of Wales Foundation at Buckingham Palace, St. James&#x2019;s Palace, and Kensington Palace. In those imposing surroundings, I had brief conversations with him but also witnessed his emotional intelligence as he adroitly yet cozily connected&nbsp; with&nbsp; an&nbsp; elite&nbsp; group&nbsp; of&nbsp; benefactors,&nbsp; most&nbsp; from&nbsp; the United States.<br> My encounters with Charles were tantalizing, so I decided to examine him head-on, to find out what made this&nbsp; multi-layered man tick and how he had developed since our first meeting in 1991. I had already studied him through the lens of his late wife and from the vantage point of his formidable mother. By the time I traveled to Sri Lanka, I had uncovered facets of his life that had not been apparent earlier. Now I witnessed for the first time his talent as a con- summate diplomat.<br> Mindful of the host government&#x2019;s record of genocide, torture, and kidnapping, he needed to signal sympathy for human rights while not causing offense to the authoritarian Sri Lankan president. I could see that he succeeded in walking that line as he addressed the opening session of the summit. Charles was determined to demonstrate that when he became king, he would be an effective head of the Commonwealth. The position is not hereditary and would thus require agreement on the part of the member states. It would be one of the first votes of confidence for Charles once he took the throne. That evening, hosting the black-tie banquet for Commonwealth leaders, he sought to show a more personal and relaxed approach than his mother&#x2019;s restrained manner.<br> I had observed the Queen in the same setting four years earlier in 2009, during the Commonwealth meeting in Trinidad. She had looked regal in her gown of turquoise beaded lace and white chiffon, dripping with diamonds, from her Queen Mary tiara to her famous necklace from the Nizam of Hyderabad in India, a wedding gift designed by Cartier to resemble English roses. During the reception she had turned seamlessly from one guest to another, small and steady at five foot four. She had been the matriarch of this group since becoming queen in 1952, and she had guided it through difficult and divisive times. She knew the issues and the personalities, and she was visibly and proudly their leader. As that banquet in 2009 began, she had removed her white gloves, put on her glasses, and stolen some glances at the typewritten remarks resting on her lap. She rose to make her toast, reading it verbatim, as was her habit. Her remarks were typically gracious and brief. She wished&nbsp; the heads of government well in their deliberations.<br> Now, halfway around the world in 2013, I could see the marked difference in style between mother and son. In his right hand, Prince Charles held several sheets of paper, on which he had written his speech in black fountain pen. His crossed-out words and underlinings were visible through the long lenses of the photographers. At five foot ten, with sloping shoulders and a long torso relative to his&nbsp;height, he seemed deceptively slight. Although he didn&#x2019;t fill the room with his presence as his mother had, he looked admirably fit. His complexion had its customary ruddy glow, and his silvery hair was swept back from his temples and coiffed to conceal his bald patches and to minimize his prominent ears. He flashed an easy and engaging smile, lifting his eyebrows for emphasis. His deep chuckle rumbled its way into a guffaw.<br> &#x201c;Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,&#x201d; he began in a voice that had grown deep and honeyed with age. But he quickly dispensed with formalities to offer a six-minute overview of his long- standing connections to the Commonwealth countries and their leaders. When he told the audience he felt part of a family, he got a round of enthusiastic applause.<br> I saw the Duchess of Cornwall, his wife of nearly nine years, formerly Camilla Parker Bowles, his longtime mistress, watching him intently. As the world knew, she had been the subject of scandal and controversy during Charles&#x2019;s life, especially during his eleven- year marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. Now Camilla had become established in the royal family. During the reception before dinner, I had noticed her beaming at the cameras in the press pen, occasion- ally nudging her husband&#x2014;no fan of photographers or reporters&#x2014; to smile.<br> At age sixty-six, the duchess was more handsome than pretty, with high cheekbones, lines and furrows befitting her age, and a strong jaw. Like the Queen, Camilla had resisted the temptation of plastic surgery, and she had thickened a bit over the years. It seemed to me that what she lacked in classical beauty, she made up for with the expressiveness of her eyes and the play of mischief in her smile. Her low and husky voice hinted at Marlboros and gin.<br> In that instant, it was easy for me to imagine Charles and Camilla as king and queen. Given the tangled history of their romance over four decades&#x2014;the scandals, deceptions, and divorces, Diana&#x2019;s retaliatory behavior, affairs, and shocking death in August 1997&#x2014; the moment seemed all the more remarkable. Theirs was a love story framed by a deep and abiding bond, by Charles&#x2019;s loyalty and devotion and Camilla&#x2019;s understanding and support.&nbsp;<br><br> For a few hours in a ballroom in steamy Sri Lanka, Charles was the center of attention, and he clearly savored the spotlight. Back home, he was often put in the shade by his revered mother, by his dazzling son Prince William and his beautiful wife, Catherine, by their son Prince George (and, later, Princess Charlotte), by William&#x2019;s enormously popular brother, Prince Harry, and by the memory of Diana, fixed in time at age thirty-six as the tragic and beloved Princess of Wales. Closer to his destiny than ever, Charles had become a shadow king-in-waiting.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Poor Charles&#x201d; was a constant refrain in my researches. It was spoken in despair by those who loved him, with sarcasm by those who resented him. Despite his gilded upbringing&#x2014;the palaces and leafy retreats, the cosseting and automatic deference&#x2014;his was a life of frustration. His every step along the way was inspected and analyzed: his promise, his awkwardness, his happiness, his suffering, his betrayals and embarrassments and mistakes, his loneliness, his successes&#x2014;and especially his relentless search for meaning, approval, and love.<br> He was undeniably better prepared to be king than his twentieth- century predecessors as Prince of Wales. His playboy great-uncle, King Edward VIII, had abdicated in 1936 after eleven months on&nbsp;&nbsp; the throne to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American. His great-great-grandfather, King Edward VII, an equally sybaritic prince, had waited until age fifty-nine to succeed his mother, Queen Victoria, in 1901 and had reigned with surprising effectiveness for nine years. Even as Charles carried out traditional royal duties, he invented unusual entrepreneurial roles for himself. He ranged over a wide spectrum of personal initiatives and passions, taking ideas from people across society.<br> For all his striving and efforts, Charles&#x2019;s personal choices&#x2014;good and bad&#x2014;shaped the view people had of his character, ability, and personality. He was vilified and ridiculed over his disastrous marriage and bitter divorce from Diana and his adulterous affair with Camilla. In the nearly two decades after Diana&#x2019;s death, Charles had battled, with considerable success, to earn respect for himself and&nbsp;acceptance for Camilla. &#x201c;Be Patient and Endure,&#x201d; read an exhortation he had framed and mounted in his dressing room.<br> By the time of his Sri Lanka star turn in November 2013, Charles was more determined than ever to win the admiration of his parents, the public, and the skeptical press. His task was to convince everyone that he was good enough to be himself.<br> I had learned that eccentricity defined his personality, that he loved risqu� jokes, that his quintessentially English self-deprecation was his reflexive way of putting people at ease. Yet in other ways, the cocoon of privilege seemed to make him oblivious to how he was perceived.<br> The future king was said by historian David Cannadine to be &#x201c;a kind of eighteenth-century country gentleman born two hundred years too late.&#x201d; In some ways Charles was disconcertingly avant-garde, but his retro beliefs and formal style of dress branded him as traditional.<br> The day before arriving in Sri Lanka, on the eve of his sixty-fifth birthday, Camilla said her husband was &#x201c;not one for chilling.&#x201d; She meant that he was rarely idle. Nevertheless, he had created a refuge in the garden of his English country estate specifically for prayer and contemplation, his ocher-colored sanctuary. His inner life had been a crucial part of his identity ever since he began a spiritual quest in his teens.<br> The Queen spent a lifetime concealing her thoughts, even her mundane likes and dislikes. But from an early age Charles felt compelled to express his fervidly held opinions in speeches and articles&#x2014; often out of deep conviction, at other times to attract attention and to compete with Diana&#x2019;s magnetic presence. He was a man in a hurry, determined to stand out by using his influence and interests. He yearned to make the world a better place according to his lights, and he was desperate to be known for his work rather than for his privileged position.<br> He chatted briefly with most people who met him&#x2014;just enough to show his interest and his charm, with a factual flash or two&#x2014;but was equally capable of forty-five-minute riffs without notes. He had an elephantine memory as well as a capacious mind. I was told by&nbsp;many that his thinking, like his office, was disorderly. To an unexpected degree, he relied heavily on the United States for inspiration and guidance. He counted on dozens of Americans both to advise him and to financially support his&nbsp; causes.<br> I found that much about Prince Charles was poorly understood, not least the extent of his originality. After four years of interviewing more than three hundred friends, family members, Palace officials, and others with unique perspectives on myriad aspects of his life, traveling with him in Britain and abroad, visiting his homes and his charities, and reading private correspondence, I learned that he was far different from the stereotype that had hardened during his marriage to Diana. Asked which parent he most resembled, his cousin Lady Pamela Hicks hesitated, then joked, &#x201c;I think he must&nbsp;&nbsp; be a changeling&#x201d;&#x2014;in other words, not discernibly like either. When he first met the poet and scholar Kathleen Raine in 1990, she mentioned a friend in India who told her, &#x201c;It takes four years to get a first-class university education, but it takes forty to get over it.&#x201d; The prince replied, &#x201c;I have been working on it for twenty.&#x201d;<br> I wanted to explain the sources of his insecurities and his strengths as well as the genesis of his causes. Why did he marry Diana, who at twenty was twelve years younger than he and, more pertinently, a woman he barely knew after just a dozen dates? How deeply was he marked by that profoundly unhappy first marriage? How did he find the resilience and the means to bounce back after Diana&#x2019;s death? What was the allure of Camilla, and why couldn&#x2019;t Charles let her go? What kind of father was he, and how did William and Harry not only survive their traumatic childhood years but thrive as adults to become the most sought-after members of the royal family?<br> When he was forty-two years old, his age when we first met, Prince Charles wrote of the &#x201c;giant paradox of Nature Herself which is reflected over and over again in ourselves. Everything has an opposite within it. Every advantage has a disadvantage, every success a failure.&#x201d; The &#x201c;secret,&#x201d; he added, was to be aware of one&#x2019;s internal paradoxes and to try to resolve them. I wondered if the contradictions of this driven, mercurial, and multifaceted man were in fact&nbsp;irreconcilable. In any event, they would have major consequences for Britain, for the lives of those around him, and for the future of the British monarchy. His status was determined from birth. How he dealt with that fate in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is the story of a most improbable life.&nbsp;<br><br> CHAPTER 1<br> The Lonely Schoolboy &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before the stroke of midnight on November 14, 1948, Prince Charles Philip Arthur George officially became public property.&nbsp;...</p><h2>Discovering Soul Care (Soul Care Resources)</h2><p>If we look at the spiritual life through the lens of a marathon, we will discover that many of us are nearing exhaustion.

Yet there are very few individually made knives in existence, and few people who know how to make knives. Step by Step Knifemaking, by master knifemaker David Boye, is widely regarded as the classic on the art of handcrafted knives. Thorough, clear, detailed instructions guide the reader through each step in how to make a knife. Generously illustrated with photos and drawings on most pages, this book reads like a one-on-one workshop with a thoughtful teacher. The reader is led to discover the spiritual connection between himself and his work, to develop his sense of artistry, and to acquire practical skills for self-sufficiency. Completely self-taught, the author guides the beginning knifemaker through the thinking processes necessary to make a knife; inspires confidence in the reader to begin at his own skill level; and shows how it can be done on a financial shoestring. Topics covered include tools, setting up a shop, knife design, grinding, heat treating, polishing, sharpening, blade etching, sheath making, and more. Boye&#39;s outdoor knives, kitchen cutlery, and utility knives are functional and &#34;peace-loving,&#34; and the chapter on etching designs into the blades is one of the few guides to this unique art in print. With over 175,000 copies in print, Step by Step Knifemaking has deeply moved thousands to involve themselves in this craft, and they constitute a visible portion of today&#39;s knifemakers. This book can impel the reader to a personally satisfying, alternative backyard career, making his own useful knife art. It is an enjoyable, indispensable reference for those wanting to learn knifemaking, become more self-reliant, or for anyone with an interest in the ancient craft of blades. &#34;Handmade knives are unique,&#34; writes David Boye, &#34;reflecting the skills and personality of their maker. They impart a personal touch to what would be a cold impersonal item. Thus it is with a handmade knife, or a handmade article of any kind, that there is a subtle exchange of electromagnetic energy that is transferred from the heart and the hands of the craftsman to the heart of the person who sees and uses the handmade article. Hopefully, the product will be the embodiment and expression of love and beauty in a useful, sanitary, and safe cutting tool - a hint of a deeper, more profound spirit in the process of living.&#34; 272 pages; 170 illustrations; 155 photographs.</p><p>Knifemaking may strike you as a curious endeavor. With so many good knives available, you might ask, why would anyone want to make one by hand? <p>That very question coursed through my mind when a friend who worked in the office next to mine began talking to me about the knives he was making. Almost every day he would work the word knife into our conversations in some way. And samples of the different blades he was making would be placed casually on his desk, used as paperweights and letter openers. </p><p>I was surprised by the beauty and especially the uniqueness of those handmade knives. They were sleek and graceful, with a more personal and mellow look than commercial knives. I knew that my friend was strictly a beginner at this craft. And he had no great amount of experience in metal or woodworking, either. Yet after just a few weeks of experience, he was making beautiful knives. </p><p>Finally, his goading got to me, and I ordered a blade from a company selling knifemaking supplies. My initial project was not to make a whole knife, but just to fashion a handle for a blade that had been turned out by machine. Soon I was gluing, cutting, filing, grinding, and sanding away at my own knife project. </p><p>My knifemaking lasted perhaps a year, and I turned out three knives before directing my attention to other crafts and recreations. But I was happy to have had the experience, not so much because I made exceptional knives but because I was able to feel the relationship that develops between a person and a knife that is made for personal use. </p><p>A knife is perhaps the most basic and useful of all tools. Most of us develop favorites among the knives we keep in our homes for kitchen use, gardening, sport, and carving. When you reach for a knife, you automatically feel for the one that you like, that has served you best in the past, or that has some unique attraction to you that is hard to explain. </p><p>When you have made a knife yourself and have shaped the blade just the way you want it and the handle is made to fit your own hand, a special relationship develops between you and that tool. David Boye says that effectively and even eloquently in this book, but putting the feeling into words captures only part of the experience. Just as you feel the handle of a knife, you also feel the specialness of a handle that is of your own making. And when you have ground and filed a blade to suit a purpose that is clear in your own mind, you have a special, more personal feeling when you use that blade. </p><p>In this age when we are flooded with machine-made products for almost every conceivable purpose, the experience of making and using your own special knife becomes more important. Making a knife is like fashioning a key to a wider awareness of your own abilities and relationship to tools. These days, we have too few such opportunities. </p><p>- Robert Rodale<br>Rodale Press <br>(original publisher)</p>David Boye has been a full time artist knifemaker since 1972. He is on the leading edge of blademaking science through his historic discovery and development of Dendritic Steel and Dendritic Cobalt. <p> </p><p>Completely self-taught, David started making knives from used sawmill blades. In 1976, Rodale Press published his book, Step-by-Step Knifemaking, which explains how to make knives using recycled materials and readily available equipment. This popular text has sold over 150,000 copies to date, and has influenced the careers of many custom knifemakers working today. </p><p>In 1980, David began experimenting with the technique of investment casting for making knife blades. He discovered that casting produces a dendritic (fern-like) network of carbide crystals throughout the steel, and that dendritic steel blades hold an edge from 2 to 50 times longer than other steels commonly used for cutlery. His work is considered to be a revolutionary breakthrough in modern knifemaking. </p><p>David was born in San Mateo in 1941, and grew up in the Bay Area. His academic background was primarily in psychology (B.A. San Jose State, 1964, M.A. San Jose State, 1965), and included a minor in Art. He also completed 2 and 1/2 years towards a doctorate degree in Social Psychology at the University of Minnesota. </p><p>David makes a variety of knives for the home and the outdoors. He specializes in a dendritic cobalt boat knife, which was rated #1 Sailor's Knife by the highly respected, independent journal Practical Sailor. His work has been shown in more than 50 galleries and museums, including the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., as well as in Japan and Europe.

You want a cup of tea?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded and followed him into his kitchen, trying to keep my eyes on anything but his muscled shoulders and tight ass. I didn&#x2019;t try very hard.</p><p>Standing by his kitchen counter, I was lost in thought about the evening ahead of us as Cam made the tea and coffee, when I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. I glanced toward it and nearly had full-on heart failure at the size of the spider clinging to Cam&#x2019;s kitchen tiles.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my God!&#x201d; I squealed, skittering back away from it, a lump of fear in my throat the size of Canada.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2014;what?&#x201d; Cam spun around, his eyes wide on me.</p><p>I stared round-eyed at the spider. &#x201c;Get rid of it or I won&#x2019;t be able to move.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t kidding. I was literally frozen with fear. I don&#x2019;t know where my phobia of spiders originated, but it was bad enough that we had to invest in spider repellents that plugged into the sockets in our flat.</p><p>We got the rare few spiders nevertheless and Cole always took care of them.</p><p>Cam looked from me to the spider and then back to me again. I could see the beginning of a smile start to curl the corners of his mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about laughing. It&#x2019;s not funny.&#x201d;</p><p>His gaze softened as he seemed to finally realize the extent of my fear. &#x201c;Okay. Stop panicking.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll get rid of it.&#x201d; He reached into a cupboard and pulled out a pan.</p><p>I scowled. &#x201c;What are you doing? Don&#x2019;t kill it!&#x201d;</p><p>Cam froze, cocking his head in bemusement as he gazed at me. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you want me to kill it? I thought you were frightened of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am <i>terrified</i> of it.&#x201d; I corrected him. &#x201c;But what does it say about humans as a species if we go around killing things just because we fear them?&#x201d; <i>Not anything good, that&#x2019;s what.</i></p><p>Cam&#x2019;s gorgeous eyes warmed even more and I found myself forgetting the fear and falling into his gaze.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I whispered, feeling my chest swell at the way he was looking at me. No one had ever looked at me like that before.</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;Nothing. You just . . . Nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cam?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The spider.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>He blinked a little rapidly before pinning the spider with his gaze. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; He lifted the lid of the pan. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not killing it. I just needed something to put it in.&#x201d;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he rescued the spider from me and me from the spider, I crammed myself into the corner of the kitchen, scared that Cam wouldn&#x2019;t move quickly enough and the spider would somehow launch itself across the room at me. I had no reason to fear. Cam had the spider in the pan in record time and I watched with growing relief as he took it to the kitchen window and deposited it outside.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I breathed.</p><p>Cam didn&#x2019;t reply. Instead he shut the window carefully, put the pan by the sink, and turned around to gaze at me.</p><p>Suddenly the air felt electric between us, like it always did while we worked side by side at the bar. I&#x2019;d done my darndest to make sure those moments were confined to the bar, trying to feign ordinary interaction outside in the real world.</p><p>Today there would be no feigning.</p><p>I held my breath at the intensity in Cam&#x2019;s eyes as he slowly began to make his way toward me.</p><p>When he closed the distance that would be considered socially acceptable between two friends who both had partners, I was just about to question him, stall him, but then my breasts brushed his chest and the words got sucked right back into my mouth along with all the air in the room. I felt his hands in a gentle embrace around my upper arms, his aftershave familiar and intoxicating, and the heat of his body made mine languid. I hadn&#x2019;t been able to meet his eyes, and so I was looking at his throat when he leaned in and pressed the sweetest kiss to my forehead. A yearning, deep and expanding, burst open in my chest and I melted into him, feeling his lips chase a delicious shiver across my skin. He replaced his mouth with his own forehead. I closed my eyes as he closed his and we rested against one another, breathing each other in. I was filled with such longing, a longing only intensified because I knew it was reciprocated.</p><p>&#x201c;Cam,&#x201d; I whispered, wanting him to pull away and needing him to never leave.</p><p>He groaned and gently slid his forehead down the side of mine, his nose skimming my cheek, following my jaw, and coming to rest in a nuzzle against my throat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>I held my breath, waiting.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>His hot lips touched the skin there. One brush. Two.</p><p>And then I felt the wet, erotic touch of tongue and I shuddered, falling against him. My nipples pebbled against my thin shirt, begging him to go further.</p><p>A sharp, piercing ringtone shattered the air between us and I jerked back, coming to my senses.</p><p>Cam cursed, his jaw clenched so tight it was close to shattering. He reached for his phone on the counter beside us and then blanched as he read the caller ID. He shot me an unfathomable look.</p><p>&#x201c;Becca,&#x201d; he stated grimly.</p></p><h2>Exodus And Revolution</h2><p>A noted political philosopher offers a moving meditation on the political meanings of the biblical story of Exodus -- from oppression to deliverance and the promised land.</p><p><b>Michael Walzer</b> is Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, and the author of many widely heralded books, including <i>Spheres of Justice, Exodus and Revolution</i>, and <i>The Company of Critics</i>, all available from Basic Books.

If I had known then what I know now, I might have chosen not to love her. But is love ever truly a choice?<br> - CHAPTER 1 -<p></p> VERONYKA<p></p> <br>VERONYKA GATHERED THE BONES of the dead.<br> <br>Joints of venison blackened and burned on the spit, and racks of ribs stewed so long that they were dry and brittle as driftwood. She dug through rotten lettuce and potato peelings for tiny, sharp-as-daggers fish bones and the hollow, delicate bones of birds.<br> <br>The small owl perched on her shoulder hooted softly in distaste at her most recent discovery. Veronyka shushed him gently, piling the bird bones inside her basket with the rest and standing.<br> <br>It was late evening, the cool night air threatening frost. The village streets were empty and quiet, with no one to notice the solitary girl digging through their garbage heaps. The clouds above glowed iron gray, obscuring the full moon and making it almost impossible to see in the darkness. That was why she&#x2019;d called the owl to be her guide. His eyes were precise in the black of night, and with a nudge to her mind, he showed Veronyka the way over rocks and boulders and under low-hanging branches. In her haste, she tripped and stumbled anyway; Val had told her to hurry, and she knew better than to keep her sister waiting.<br> <br>Excitement and anticipation crackled in her veins, tinged with no small amount of fear&#x2014;would tonight finally be the night?<br> <br>Veronyka&#x2019;s breath created clouds in front of her face as she made her way back to the cabin she and Val shared. It was small and had been deserted when they&#x2019;d found it, the bright blue paint peeling on its front door and the shutters broken, probably used during the warmer months for hunting and then abandoned during the rainy winter season. The weather was getting drier and hotter with each passing day, so they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to stay much longer. Another home, come and gone.<br> <br>As the cabin came into view, Veronyka&#x2019;s insides contracted. The thick column of smoke that had been billowing from the chimney when she left was nothing more than a thin stream of ghostly wisps. They were running out of time.<br> <br>She ran the last few steps, the flimsy wooden door thwacking against the stone wall as she pushed her way into the single room. All was darkness, save for the orange flicker of the glowing embers. The smell of smoke was heavy in the air, the taste of ash bitter on her tongue.<br> <br>Val stood in front of the round hearth in the middle of the cabin, turning at the sound of Veronyka&#x2019;s entrance. She wore an impatient, agitated expression as she snatched the basket from Veronyka&#x2019;s grip and stared in at its contents.<br> <br>She snorted in disapproval. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the best you can do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; she said, tossing it carelessly aside, half the bones spilling onto the packed earthen floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;You said to hurry,&#x201d; Veronyka objected, looking around Val to see that the fire burned hot and low beneath a pile of new kindling. These weren&#x2019;t the boiled or spit-blackened bones of animals, though. These were large white bones.<br> <br>Human-looking bones.<br> <br>Val followed her line of sight and answered the unasked question. &#x201c;And still you took too long, so I went looking on my own.&#x201d;<br> <br>A shudder ran down Veronyka&#x2019;s spine despite the heat.<br> <br>She tugged at the heavy wool cloak that was wrapped around her shoulders, and her owl guide, whom she&#x2019;d completely forgotten about, ruffled his feathers.<br> <br>The movement drew her sister&#x2019;s attention. Veronyka froze, her muscles tingling as she awaited her sister&#x2019;s reaction. Would she fly off the handle, like she often did, or would she let the animal&#x2019;s presence slide?<br> <br>The owl twitched nervously, shifting from foot to foot under Val&#x2019;s gaze. Veronyka tried to soothe him, but her own anxiety was rippling across the surface of her skin. A moment later his clawed feet dug into Veronyka&#x2019;s shoulder, and he glided soundlessly out the still-open door.<br> <br>Veronyka shut it behind him, taking her time before she faced her sister, dreading the argument that was sure to come. They were both animages&#x2014;able to understand and communicate with animals&#x2014;but they had very different views on what that meant. Val believed animals should be treated and used as tools. Compelled, controlled, dominated.<br> <br>Veronyka, on the other hand, felt kinship with animals, not superiority over them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Loving them is weakness,&#x201d; Val warned, her back to Veronyka as she crouched before the hearth. She added some of the smaller bones from Veronyka&#x2019;s basket to the growing flames, piling them carefully around the sides of two smooth gray eggs, blackened and streaked with soot. They sat amid the glowing hot embers in a bed of bone and ash, tongues of fire licking up their sides.<br> <br>Though Veronyka couldn&#x2019;t see Val&#x2019;s face, she could imagine the fervor in her eyes. Veronyka expelled a slow, somewhat exasperated breath. They&#x2019;d had this conversation before.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Riders didn&#x2019;t treat their mounts like pets to be cuddled and fawned over, Veronyka. They were warriors, phoenixaeres, and their bond wasn&#x2019;t love. It was duty. Honor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phoenixaeres. Even with Val&#x2019;s scolding, excitement blazed in Veronyka&#x2019;s heart whenever her sister spoke about Phoenix Riders&#x2014;animages who&#x2019;d bonded with phoenixes. The literal translation of the ancient Pyraean word was &#x201c;phoenix masters,&#x201d; something Val often reminded her of. Only ani-mages could become Riders, because only through their magic could they hatch, communicate with, and ride the legendary creatures.<br> <br>It was all Veronyka had ever wanted. To be a Phoenix Rider like the warrior queens of old.<br> <br>She wanted to soar through the sky on phoenix-back, to be fierce and brave like Lyra the Defender or Avalkyra Ashfire, the Feather-Crowned Queen.<br> <br>But it had been more than sixteen years since the last Phoenix Riders had graced the Golden Empire&#x2019;s skies. Most had died in the Blood War, when Avalkyra and her sister, Pheronia, were pitted against each other in a battle for the empire&#x2019;s throne. The rest had been labeled traitors for turning against the empire and were hunted down and executed afterward. Practicing animal magic without registering and paying heavy taxes had been made illegal, and animages like Veronyka and Val had to live in secrecy and squalor, hiding their abilities, in constant fear of being captured and forced into servitude.<br> <br>During their glory days, the Phoenix Riders were guardians above all else, and for Veronyka, even the idea of them had been a shining beacon of hope when she was growing up. Her grandmother had always promised that one day the Phoenix Riders would return. One day it would be safe to be an animage again. And when her grandmother had died, Veronyka had vowed to become one herself. She wanted to be the light in the darkness for other poor, lonely animages living in hiding. She wanted the strength and the means to fight and protect others like her and Val. The strength she hadn&#x2019;t had to protect her grandmother.<br> <br>Maybe the Phoenix Riders as a military order were gone, but you needed only two things if you wanted to be a phoenixaeris: animal magic and a phoenix.<br> <br>Veronyka moved around Val to kneel next to the hearth. The phoenix eggs nestled there were roughly the size of her cupped hands, and their color and texture were so similar to that of natural stones that they could easily be overlooked. It was a defense mechanism, Val had said, so that phoenixes could lay their eggs in secret and leave them unguarded for years until they&#x2014;or an animage&#x2014;came to hatch them. The Riders often concealed eggs as well, placing secret caches inside statues and sacred spaces, but many had been destroyed by the empire during the war.<br> <br>Veronyka and Val had been searching for phoenix eggs for years&#x2014;in every run-down temple, abandoned Rider outpost, and forgotten building they could find. They&#x2019;d traded meals for information, sold stolen goods for wagon rides, and made other transactions Val wouldn&#x2019;t let her see. After their grandmother had died, Val had been determined to get them out of Aura Nova, the capital of the empire, and into Pyra&#x2014;but it hadn&#x2019;t been easy. Travel outside the empire after the war had been closely monitored, as many of Avalkyra Ashfire&#x2019;s allies had tried to get into Pyra to avoid persecution. In the years since, with the threat of bondage or poverty under the magetax, many animages had tried to do the same. Pyra had once been a province of the empire, but it had declared its autonomy under Avalkyra Ashfire&#x2019;s leadership. With the death of its Feather-Crowned Queen, it had become a lawless, somewhat dangerous place&#x2014;but it was still safer for animages than the empire.<br> <br>Without proper identification, Veronyka and Val hadn&#x2019;t been able to cross the border. Plus, they were animages&#x2014;if their magic had been discovered, they would have been put into bondage. So they&#x2019;d been forced to travel within the empire, Val leading, Veronyka following. They&#x2019;d slept in ditches, on rooftops, in the pouring rain and the sweltering heat. Val would disappear&#x2014;sometimes for days&#x2014;then return with blood on her shirt and a coin purse in her hands.<br> <br>Those had been hard times, but they&#x2019;d finally bribed their way onto a merchant caravan and been smuggled into Pyra, their parents&#x2019; homeland. Veronyka had been certain that, finally, their luck would change. And after several long months, it had.<br> <br>Val had found two perfect phoenix eggs hidden in a crumbling temple deep in the wilderness of Pyra. One for each of them.<br> <br>Just thinking about that day brought a prickle of tears to Veronyka&#x2019;s eyes, a surge of emotion that she fought to keep in check. Whenever Val caught sight of Veronyka&#x2019;s euphoric smile at the prospect of what they were doing, she&#x2019;d meet it with cold, hard truths: Sometimes eggs didn&#x2019;t hatch. Sometimes the phoenix inside chose not to bond or died during the incubation process.<br> <br>Even now, Val didn&#x2019;t smile or take joy in the sight of the eggs in the hearth. Their incubation was as somber as a funeral pyre.<br> <br>A bone snapped in the hearth, and a cloud of ash rose up. Veronyka held her breath so she wouldn&#x2019;t inhale the dead, drawing a circle on her forehead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop that,&#x201d; Val snapped, seeing Veronyka&#x2019;s hand and swatting it aside. Her beautiful face was a severe mask, her warm brown skin painted with black shadows and swathes of red and orange from the firelight. &#x201c;Axura&#x2019;s Eye should not be called for some silly superstition. That&#x2019;s for peasants and fishermen, not you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Val was never much for religion, but Axura was the god most sacred to Pyraeans&#x2014;and Phoenix Riders&#x2014;so she usually let Veronyka say prayers or give thanks. Still, she hated the small superstitions, turning up her nose and pretending she and Veronyka were somehow above the local villagers and working-class people they&#x2019;d lived among all their lives. They hadn&#x2019;t had a proper home since they were children, and even that was a hovel in the Narrows, the poorest district of Aura Nova. Right now they were squatting on the floor of another person&#x2019;s cottage. Who were they, if not peasants?<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you eaten?&#x201d; Veronyka asked, changing the subject. Val wore that fanatical look on her face again, and heavy bags sat under her eyes. Val was only seventeen, but in her exhaustion she appeared much older. Quietly Veronyka moved away from the fire to dig through their box of food stores, which were getting dangerously low.<br> <br>&#x201c;I had some of the salt fish,&#x201d; Val answered, her voice taking on the familiar distant tenor that came over her after too much time fire gazing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Val, we ran out of the fish two days ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged, a jerking twitch of the shoulder, and Veronyka sighed. Val hadn&#x2019;t eaten since she&#x2019;d found the eggs. For all her intelligence and cunning, she often lost track of the mundane activities that made up daily life. Veronyka was the one who cooked their meals and mended their clothes, who worried about sleep and nutrition and a clean home. Val&#x2019;s mind was always elsewhere&#x2014;on people and places long gone, or on distant dreams and future possibilities.<br> <br>As she continued to search through their stores, Veronyka unearthed an almost-empty sack of rice. They&#x2019;d have to find something worth trading in the village the next day, or they&#x2019;d go hungry.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know we won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Val said, speaking into the flames.<br> <br>Immediately realizing her mistake, Veronyka closed her eyes. She&#x2019;d been projecting her thoughts and concerns into the open air, where anyone&#x2014;where Val&#x2014;could snatch them up. While their shared ability to speak into the minds of animals was fairly common&#x2014;one in ten people, Val said, though it was higher in Pyra&#x2014;their ability to speak into human minds was as rare as a phoenix egg. Shadowmages, they were called, and for two sisters to have the gift was even rarer. Unlike animal magic, shadow magic wasn&#x2019;t hereditary, and as far as Veronyka knew, most people thought it was a myth. It existed only in old stories and epic poems, a magical ability belonging to ancient Pyraean queens and long-dead heroes.<br> <br>While they had to be careful with their animal magic since it had been outlawed in the empire, they had to be extra cautious when it came to shadow magic. People in Pyra would often let animages be, but if anyone were to catch Veronyka and Val using shadow magic, they would almost certainly be turned in. For every legend of a powerful Phoenix Rider queen with an uncanny ability to tell truths from lies, there was also a cautionary tale about a dark witch who corrupted souls and controlled minds. It was mostly nonsense, Veronyka suspected, but people often rejected and distrusted things they didn&#x2019;t understand. She and Val were safest if they kept their shadow magic to themselves.<br> <br>Of course, that didn&#x2019;t stop Val from using it on Veronyka whenever she pleased.<br> <br>Guard your mind, Val said, speaking the words inside Veronyka&#x2019;s head rather than out loud. Like speaking to animals, shadow magic could be used to communicate, or it could be used to influence a person&#x2019;s will: to order and command. Val often used the latter to get them food or clothes or shelter, but she only ever turned shadow magic on Veronyka to communicate. As far as Veronyka knew. Still, she could see Val was tempted sometimes, when Veronyka disobeyed and refused to listen, and she could understand the danger of such a powerful ability.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m making dinner,&#x201d; Veronyka announced, drawing her thoughts and feelings inward and putting up mental walls to surround and protect them, just like Val had taught her. She was usually better at keeping her mind guarded, but they&#x2019;d been tending the fire for two days, and in her exhaustion, her emotions were raw and close to the surface. Cooking some food would help distract her from the alternating surges of fluttering anticipation and aching dread that were in constant flux inside her. The closer they got to the moment of hatching, the more terrified she became that it would go wrong, that it would all be for nothing.<br> <br>Everything rested upon those two round rocks in the fire.<br> <br>Veronyka lifted their heavy clay pot and hoisted it over to the edge of the hearth, the bag of rice tucked under her arm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve still got some onions and dried meat to make broth, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Val?&#x201d;<br> <br>Veronyka caught the scent of singed fabric. Val crouched so near the flames that the hem of her tunic was smoking, but she was still as a statue, oblivious to the heat, a steady stream of tears making tracks down her soot-smeared cheeks.<br> <br>Veronyka&#x2019;s heart constricted, and she looked into the flames, expecting ...</p><h2>Positive Addiction (Harper Colophon Books)</h2><p>The author of <em>Reality Therapy</em> and <em>Take Effective Control of Your Life</em> shows readers how to gain strength and self-esteem through positive behavior.</p><p><p>William Glasser, M.D., is a world-renowned psychiatrist who lectures widely.

She is a voice for the outlier, and we&#x2019;re famished for what she has to say.&#x201d; --Jen Hatmaker, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Of Mess and Moxie</i> and<i> For the Love</i><br><b> &nbsp;<br> Wildly popular blogger "Jamie the Very Worst Missionary" delivers a searing, offbeat, often hilarious memoir of spiritual disintegration and re-formation.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> As a quirky Jewish kid and promiscuous punkass teen, Jamie Wright never imagines becoming a Christian, let alone a Christian missionary. She is barely an adult when the trials of motherhood and marriage put her on an unexpected collision course with Jesus. After finding her faith at a suburban megachurch, Jamie trades in the easy life on the cul-de-sac for the green fields of Costa Rica. There, along with her family, she earnestly hopes to serve God and change lives. But faced with a yawning culture gap and persistent shortcomings in herself and her fellow workers, she soon loses confidence in the missionary enterprise and falls into a funk of cynicism and despair.<br><br> Nearly paralyzed by depression, yet still wanting to make a difference, she decides to tell the whole, disenchanted truth: Missionaries suck and our work makes no sense at all! From her sofa in Central America, she launches a renegade blog,<i> Jamie the Very Worst Missionary</i>, and against all odds wins a large and passionate following. Which leads her to see that maybe a "bad" missionary--awkward, doubtful, and vocal&#x2014;is exactly what the world and the throngs of American do-gooders need.&nbsp;<br><br><i> The Very Worst Missionary</i> is a disarming, ultimately inspiring spiritual memoir for well-intentioned contrarians everywhere. It will appeal to readers of Nadia Bolz-Weber, Jen Hatmaker, Ann Lamott, Jana Reiss, Mallory Ortberg, and Rachel Held Evans.</p><p>JAMIE WRIGHT blogs at <i>Jamie the Very Worst Missionary,</i> and travels widely to speak in support of groups working against human trafficking. She lives with her husband, their teenage sons, and their celebrity cat, Knives, in Northern California.<p>1</p><p>The Very Worst Missionary</p><p>The year I turned thirty-two, I took a deep breath and marched boldly into full-time ministry as a missionary to Costa Rica. I wasn&#x2019;t alone in this soul-saving, world-changing, God-pleasing endeavor--my husband, Steve, and our three sons (thirteen, nine, and seven at the time) were also in on this adventure. People often assume that our kids must be oh so grateful to have been given the gift of worldly perspective during their early years, so allow me to dispel that fantasy. Today, as young adults, our children all agree we pretty much ruined their lives by dragging them off to a faraway land, saddling them with a second language, and forcing upon them a great variety of new people, places, and cultures. But, in their defense, our life overseas was kind of a shit show.</p><p>Steve and I intentionally gave up every ounce of stability we&#x2019;d enjoyed in the United States, said good-bye to our community, and took a massive financial hit to chase a dream of being a small part of something big. We were acting on what we&#x2019;d been taught: that the world needs missionaries to find the lost, feed the hungry, heal the sick, and free the enslaved. And, for a minute, it honestly seemed that simple.</p><p>Everyone kept saying how awesome everything about missions was and how amazing we were for our willingness to take our family and go, and I happily, willfully believed them. Imagine my dismay when I finally came face to face with this thing called Christian missions and what I found was actually countless ways in which things were not awesome or amazing.</p><p>Costa Rica was a tiny Catholic country practically overrun with North American Evangelicals, many of whom were arrogant, lazy, inconsiderate, manipulative, and self-absorbed. The work of missionaries was often subpar or nonexistent, wasteful, and, at times, even harmful to the local culture and economy. But the pervading understanding was that every missionary, including me, was called by God, and that through our mere presence and our important &#x201c;work&#x201d; we were changing the world. When Steve and I flew away to play house in another country, we&#x2019;d built a whole new life on this premise, which almost immediately I began to suspect was false, or at the very least deeply flawed.</p><p>I wanted to talk about the questions and doubts I was having, but I didn&#x2019;t know how people would respond if I started to pick away at the accepted narrative that all missions are good missions and all missionaries are good missionaries. There seemed to be a great deal of evidence to the contrary, but could I dare to tell a different story?</p><p>In the spirit of self-preservation, I could sit here and say, &#x201c;The truth is, I saw a lot of unfit missionaries doing unnecessary stuff, which made me uncomfortable.&#x201d; But the whole truth is that I wrestled with the broad practice of Christian missions, in part because I was a hot mess of a missionary, a perfect example of at least a dozen things that are wrong with the system. And I knew that if I were to expose the ugly truths I&#x2019;d seen, I would have to acknowledge that I&#x2019;d seen a lot of them in me.</p><p>I curled up in a ball and sucked my thumb, while Steve took to life in Costa Rica like a hot chick to Coachella.</p><p>His daily grind as the director of buildings and operations for our organization&#x2019;s Latin American headquarters came with a never-ending list of things to do. Between new projects and old maintenance on the ministry campus, a steady flow of work allowed him to dive right into friendly relationships with landscapers, construction workers, contractors, and every single human being who worked at a hardware or building-supply store within a twenty-mile radius. It wasn&#x2019;t long before everywhere we went someone came up to shake hands and say hello to the big, friendly gringo with the bad accent who worked up on the mountain.</p><p>Unabashed, industrious, openhanded, and approachable; in so many ways, Steve was a very good missionary.</p><p>And I was just like him, but, like, the complete opposite.</p><p>When I had to psych myself up just to put on pants and go out for laundry detergent, Steve was braving the packed corridors of the dingy government hospital in Alajuela, because he had learned he could donate blood to offset the cost of a transfusion for his building foreman&#x2019;s wife. While I was thinking of ways to avoid talking to taxi drivers more than absolutely necessary, Steve was getting to know local shop owners and their employees by name. While I stuck strictly to the routes, rituals, and cultural rules I knew and trusted, he made a point of exploring and experiencing everything he possibly could. I was envious of how easily Steve transitioned into life in Costa Rica, and he was truly baffled that it wasn&#x2019;t as easy for me.</p><p>Since I was practically a hermit without much on my plate and Steve was always busy with one thousand things, I quietly took over the unofficial role of communications director for our clan. I&#x2019;d never written anything in my life, but from my favorite spot on the sofa, I could keep our family, friends, and supporters filled in on our wild and wacky day-to-day lives. It was my responsibility to make sure updates included dramatic shots of three pasty white boys in a sea of brown people, and artsy pics of fresh produce, weird cuts of meat, and towers of pirated DVDs for sale under brightly colored tarps at the Saturday-morning markets. Snapshots of brilliant sunsets, torrential rainfalls, stray dogs with hilarious underbites, and oxcarts blocking traffic also served well to help me tell our story.</p><p>Along with a few of those &#x201c;look at our crazy life&#x201d; pics, our first update went out with an image of my smiling husband, submerged waist deep in a swimming pool with his arm around the Costa Rican guy he&#x2019;d just helped baptize. It was taken on our very first Sunday in the country at a baptism that just happened to be occurring in the private swimming pool where we stayed. Our family stumbled across this celebration, completely by accident, on a morning walk across the property, and a Canadian missionary generously invited Steve to join right in with the dunking. It seemed like the missionaryish thing to do, so he did.</p><p>In the update, I shared how God was already using us in awesome and amazing ways. The story was carefully worded so as not to mislead anyone into thinking we&#x2019;d done anything more than just arrive at a baptism in progress, but I did choose that picture and tell that story because it felt appropriately interesting for would-be investors, and it was an optimistic way to show supporters that the Wright family was a wise choice for their missionary money. We never saw the baptized guy again, but he sure gave us something to write home about, which is lucky, because writing home is key to a missionary&#x2019;s livelihood.</p><p>Now we cringe so hard at that picture, having since developed ethical objections to the use of people as fodder for the Christian-Missions Machine. After seeing firsthand the troubling results of foreigners engaged in exactly that kind of drive-by ministry, today Steve would not agree to join in, but the eagerness he showed that day, that willingness to jump right in, is exactly the kind of thing that made him a really good missionary.</p><p>I did not cannonball into a stranger&#x2019;s baptism. Instead, as the family&#x2019;s communications director, I summarized our new life as missionaries and promised readers great adventures to come. I must have been feeling very precious the day I tapped out my first blog post, because I wrapped it up with a single sentence that would come back to mock me.</p><p>&#x201c;I am pleased to report that being a missionary is pretty darn cool.&#x201d;</p><p>Sweet Jesus. Was I high when I wrote that? I don&#x2019;t know. All I know is that eighteen months later, I couldn&#x2019;t have disagreed more.</p><p>The rose-colored glasses I wore flouncing into the mission field quickly shattered and (metaphorically speaking) stabbed me in the eyeballs. I was dying to tell the truth about messed-up missions and messy me. . . . The question was, how could I break the bad news to all those people who still believed that everything missions was awesome and amazing? Should I just admit that I&#x2019;d been totally wrong? Being a missionary wasn&#x2019;t pretty darn cool; it was super goddamn hard. But was I allowed to say that? Could I share what I had learned during my first year and a half in Costa Rica: that, nope, it&#x2019;s not enough to just show up ignorant and ill prepared and expect God to work miracles? Could I say something about the alarming number of weirdos, jackasses, and dipshits out there who were also called missionaries? I just wasn&#x2019;t sure what would happen if I publicly suggested that maybe God and the world deserved so much better.</p><p>I gave all of this two whole minutes of serious consideration, and then I thought, Fuck it. Who am I here to impress? I began to write straight from my crooked little heart. Fortunately, there was no shortage of material.</p><p>I kept our blog (creatively titled The Wright Family in Costa Rica) up to date for months without a hitch, and for the most part people appreciated the new vibe of blunt honesty and the funny, straightforward approach. Of course, not everyone agreed with my thoughts or liked my style or approved of the way that I freely used the entire spectrum of the English language. The price of authenticity in missions became all too clear when, during the worst year of my life (which I promise to tell you about later), I wrote this post:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Really Happened</p><p>(Archive, 10.17.2009)</p><p>The other day I was putzing around the house in my PJs, picking up breakfast dishes, sipping coffee, and doing whatever it is I do all day. The boys were at school, Steve was at work, and the house was quiet and still. Just the way I like it. I took my Mac and my coffee to the couch, where I plopped my butt down to get some work done. (We all know that &#x201c;getting some work done&#x201d; is code for &#x201c;aimlessly scrolling Facebook,&#x201d; right?) So I was &#x201c;working&#x201d; and sipping and enjoying the quietness and stillness of a new day. And then this happened.</p><p>As it tends to do when you drink eleven cups of coffee before 9:00 a.m., nature called. And called. And called. Until, at the last possible second, I set my computer aside and sprinted off to, y&#x2019;know, take a pee. Anyway. I swooped into the bathroom, swiftly dropped my drawers, and took a seat, and when I glanced down, I was shocked to find a pair of black beady eyes looking up at me. It was a gecko--ON MY THIGH--not three inches from my lady goodies. Like, apparently this critter had just been chilling out all morning inside of my pants.</p><p>This really happened!</p><p>I. Had a lizard. In my pants.</p><p>Of course, I did what any good missionary would do. I wildly smacked at my thigh while I screamed, calling on the name of my Lord and Savior, Jesus (Shit Balls Help Me) Christ, to smite that little bastard and damn it straight to hell. And in case you&#x2019;re wondering, yes, this all happened midpee!</p><p>I&#x2019;m telling you, if you&#x2019;ve never had a midpee emergency, you should count yourself lucky. It took every ounce of control I could muster to remain seated, finish up in a calm and orderly fashion, and retreat quickly back to the living room. That&#x2019;s when I lost it, pacing back and forth like a stark raving madwoman, wheezing and muttering, &#x201c;I did not sign up for this. I did not sign up for this. I did NOT sign up for THIS.&#x201d;</p><p>And then God and I had a little heart-to-heart.</p><p>In my hysteria, I let God know quite clearly that I had had enough. &#x201c;I did not sign up,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;for lizards in my pants! I didn&#x2019;t sign up for mushrooms growing on my T-shirts. I&#x2019;m not down with having my butt grabbed by a dude on a bicycle. I am not okay with an ant colony living in the sofa. Nope, not okay. And I especially did not sign up for having my house robbed, my car stolen, and my credit card used in Vegas. . . . But this, God? . . . THIS?? . . . This is the last straw! I cannot live like this. With lizards in my pants.&#x201d;</p><p>And then I started to ugly cry. Like, really sob, with snot and tears and everything.</p><p>&#x201c;God, are you even there? All I really wanted was to serve you. All I wanted was to honor you and obey your call. All I wanted was for you to bless us for being here. You were supposed to bless us,&#x201d; I bawled. And then I lay down on the floor and cried out a year&#x2019;s worth of anger and frustration. The hysteria drained out of me, and eventually the tears and snot dried up. You can just imagine the vision of beauty I was by the time it was all over and my house was still and quiet again. Just me and the gecko . . . and God.</p><p>I guess I&#x2019;m not one of those people who learn about God in tidy, conventional ways, like going to church or reading a book. I learn about God when a creepy crawly with suction-cup toes makes it almost all the way from my ankle to the land of milk and honey. And so it took a pervy gecko to help me redefine the way I think of God&#x2019;s blessing.</p><p>Listen, I&#x2019;m not an &#x201c;audible voice of God&#x201d; kinda girl. Though I believe it can happen, it never happens to me. But on that morning, while I was wailing like a lunatic, ticking off my laundry list of hardships to the God who&#x2019;d let me down, I want to say there was the faintest whisper . . . like a breeze, like a breath of air, a response to each of my grievances. I was with you. . . . I was with you. . . . I was with you. . . .</p><p>I am with you.</p><p>And I was reminded of the real blessing of God: that He is with me. He has always been with me. He was with me before I even knew Him.</p><p>His presence is His blessing--Emanuel--God is with us.</p><p>About five seconds after I posted that story, one of our supporters called to report me to our sending agency and to tell them she would be withdrawing her fifty-dollar monthly donation. I barely knew her, but she sent me a lengthy e-mail detailing her great disappointment. In her letter, this angry old lady shared that she&#x2019;d had growing concerns about my &#x201c;demeanor&#x201d; for some time, but the breaking point had been the post about the gecko in my pants. In her e-mail the mother of all church ladies said I was &#x201c;the worst kind of missionary,&#x201d; accusing me of tarnishing the reputation of decent missionaries everywhere, and making good Christians look bad with my filthy mouth and irreverent attitude. She was &#x201c;appalled&#x201d; and &#x201c;dismayed&#x201d; and she would not support &#x201c;such blasphemy.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Brother of Jesus and the Lost Teachings of Christianity</h2><p>Reveals the true role of James, the brother of Jesus, in early Christianity <br> <br>� Uses evidence from the canonical Gospels, apocryphal texts, and the writings of the Church Fathers to reveal the teachings of Jesus as transmitted to his chosen successor: James <br> <br>� Demonstrates how the core message in the teachings of Jesus is an expansion not a repudiation of the Jewish religion <br> <br>� Shows how James can serve as a bridge between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam <br> <br>James has been a subject of controversy since the founding of the Church.

This important volume consists of two lecture courses given by Heidegger at the University of Freiburg over the Summers of 1943 and 1944 on the thought of Heraclitus. These lectures shed important light on Heidegger's understanding of Greek thinking, as well as his understanding of Germany, the history of philosophy, the Western world, and their shared destinies.</p><p><p><b>Martin Heidegger </b>(1889-1976) is regarded as one of the twentieth century's most important philosophers. <br><b></b><br><b>S. Montgomery Ewegen </b>is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Classics at Trinity College, Hartford, USA. His research and teaching are focused on Ancient philosophy, 20th Century Continental philosophy, phenomenology, and their intersections.</p><p><b>Julia Goesser Assaiante </b> is a Visiting Assistant Professor of German in the Language and Culture Studies Department at Trinity College, Hartford, USA. Her research interests concentrate on eighteenth and early twentieth-century literature and philosophy, with an emphasis on poetic language, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and currents of anti-Enlightenment thought.</p><p>&#x201c;This long awaited translation was worth the wait. J. Goesser Assaiante and S. Montgomery Ewegen have provided us with a fluid and faithful translation of two of Heidegger's most sustained and important lecture courses on early Greek thinking. These manuscripts were written in 1943 and 1944, a pivotal time in Heidegger's development. They enable one to witness up close Heidegger's attempt to work out, by way of radically original translations and interpretations of Heraclitus's fragments, his understanding of the inception of the history of Occidental philosophy. At the same time, readers are invited to follow Heidegger in his attempt, by way of recovering and rethinking the deepest insights of Heraclitus and other early Greek thinkers, to think out beyond the end of the history of metaphysics that devolved from their greatness.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bret W. Davis, Professor of Philosophy, Loyola University Maryland, USA</i></p><p>&#x201c;The translation of Heidegger's most sustained engagement with Heraclitus represents a significant contribution to Heidegger studies. These two lecture courses richly fill in Heidegger's engagement with early Greek thinking and include provocative &#x2013; often politically revelatory - discussions of Nietzsche, technology, friendship and history. The translators have succeeded in capturing Heidegger's challenging wordplay in a manner that opens up the Greek original in new and unexpected ways while remaining accessible and lucid in English.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Julia Ireland, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Whitman College, USA</i></p><p>&#x201c;These two lecture courses on Heraclitus are Heidegger at his most provocative. More than a commentary, here Heidegger attempts to think <i>through</i> Heraclitus, with wonderfully startling results for our appreciation of each. The sustained attention to the pre-Socratic sense of both physis and logos is unmatched in his oeuvre. With this long awaited translation of a central volume in Heidegger's <i>Gesamtausgabe</i>, the translators have done the English reader a great service &#x2013; not just the reader of Heidegger, but of Heraclitus as well.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrew J. Mitchell, Winship Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy, Emory University, USA</i></p><p>&#x201c;These two lecture courses, devoted to what Heidegger called the &#x201c;first [but incomplete] inception&#x201d; of Western philosophy, provide his most extended treatment of Heraclitean <i>physis </i>and <i>logos</i> as accounting for how things emerge into meaningful presence. Scholars Assaiante and Ewegen are to be highly commended for their meticulous rendering of this important text into eminently readable English.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas Sheehan, Professor of Religious Studies and, by courtesy, of Philosophy, Stanford University, USA</i></p></p><h2>Superman Vol. 1: The Unity Saga: Phantom Earth</h2><p><b>A bold new chapter for the greatest superhero of all time begins here as the superstar team of writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Ivan Reis begin their run on the all-new <i>Superman</i>!</b><br><br>The fallout from the <i>Man of Steel</i> graphic novel has Clark looking at the world through new eyes...with new ideas about what Superman could and should do for the city of Metropolis and the planet Earth.

And Dexter, of course, is back in business.</p> <strong>An Essay by Jeff Lindsay: "Dexter and Me"</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>My mother called me one night two years ago. "Well," she said. "Now I know you&#x2019;ve really made it."</p> <p>"Oh, really?" I said. "What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I&#x2019;m watching <em>Jeopardy</em>," she said. "The answer to the last question was, &#x2018;Who is Dexter?&#x2019;"</p> <p>A few nights later, my sister called. "You were just on <em>Nancy Grace</em>," she said.</p> <p>"I was?" I said, very surprised. It didn&#x2019;t seem like the kind of thing I would forget. "You mean me?"</p> <p>"No, not you," she snorted, as if I should have known better that someone like me would never be on <em>Nancy Grace</em>. "Dexter. Somebody&#x2019;s foot washed up on a beach, and she called it a real-life Dexter moment."</p> <p>And then a few weeks later my agent called. "Did you hear what they named the new robot arm for the space shuttle?" he said.</p> <p>"Let me guess," I said.</p> <p>"It&#x2019;s iconic," my agent said. "That&#x2019;s a good thing."</p> <p>And it is. Dexter is iconic. But as my sister was smart enough to pick up on, I am not. I think this is a good thing. I worked in Hollywood for a dozen years, and all I can say about it is that the primitive tribes who think the camera steals your soul were really on to something. So I don&#x2019;t want to be instantly recognizable--not Tom Cruise famous, not even Stephen King famous.</p> <p>On the other hand, if Dexter wants fame, that&#x2019;s fine with me. He deserves it: he&#x2019;s a fine, upstanding, hardworking guy who is good with kids, thoughtful to co-workers, and helpful around the house. And if he slips away now and then for a little bit of human vivisection--well, nobody&#x2019;s perfect.</p> <p>I will admit, though, that lately I&#x2019;ve begun to suffer what may be the world&#x2019;s first Edgar Rice Burroughs Complex. Like Burroughs&#x2019;s Tarzan, my character is known all over the world, and I am still anonymous. That takes some getting used to, even though there are perks. It has given me some wonderful moments--like riding into Times Square in a taxi and seeing Dexter 60 feet tall on the side of the building. "Have you seen that program?" the driver asked me.</p> <p>"I don&#x2019;t watch much TV," I said, even though I was staring like a school boy at a peep show.</p> <p>"There are books, too," he said.</p> <p>And there are. I hope you will like them. They make wonderful gifts, too. Even better, Nancy Grace and Alex Trebek will never have to see me sweat.<em>--Jeff Lindsay</em></p> <p>(Photo � Hilary Hemingway)</p><p><b>Jeff Lindsay</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Dexter novels, which debuted in 2004 with&nbsp;<b>Darkly Dreaming Dexter</b>.

Bacon's Rebellion turned into a civil war within Virginia--and a war of extermination against the colony's Indian allies--that lasted into the following winter, sending shock waves throughout the British colonies and into England itself. <br><br>James Rice offers a colorfully detailed account of the rebellion, revealing how Piscataways, English planters, slave traders, Susquehannocks, colonial officials, plunderers and intriguers were all pulled into an escalating conflict whose outcome, month by month, remained uncertain. In Rice's rich narrative, the lead characters come to life: the powerful, charismatic Governor Berkeley, the sorrowful Susquehannock warrior Monges, the wiley Indian trader and tobacco planter William Byrd, the regal Pamunkey chieftain Cockacoeske, and the rebel leader himself, Nathaniel Bacon. The dark, slender Bacon, born into a prominent family, soon earned a reputation in America as imperious, ambitious, and arrogant. But the colonial leaders did not foresee how rash and headstrong Nathaniel Bacon could be, nor how adept he would prove to be at both inciting colonists and alienating Indians. As the tense drama unfolds, it becomes apparent that the struggle between Governor Berkeley and the impetuous Bacon is nothing less than a battle over the soul of America. Bacon died in the midst of the uprising and Governor Berkeley shortly afterwards, but the profoundly important issues at the heart of the rebellion took another generation to resolve.<br><br>The late seventeenth century was a pivotal moment in American history, full of upheavals and far-flung conspiracies. <em>Tales From a Revolution</em> brilliantly captures the swirling rumors and central events of Bacon's Rebellion and its aftermath, weaving them into a dramatic tale that is part of the founding story of America.<br></p><p><br><strong>James Rice</strong> is Professor of History at SUNY Plattsburgh. He is the author of <em>Nature and History in the Potomac Country: From Hunter-Gatherers to the Age of Jefferson</em>.<br><br>"<em>Tales from a Revolution</em> is a welcome synthesis of the recent scholarship on important events of the late seventeenth century in the Chesapeake and the Atlantic world. The book is appropriate for undergraduate courses and the general reading public."--<em>The Journal of Southern History</em><p></p><br>"Important contributions include highlighting the roles of warring Indian tribes caught amid impossible dilemmas proffered by the whites, and Indian perspectives. Recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Rice accomplishes a good deal with this provocative piece of storytelling. As a work of colonial history it is notably user-friendly and resonant. And as a work of historiography it poses pressing questions that all students of history should take seriously."--Jim Cullen, <em>History News Network</em><p></p><br>"Rice energetically brings to life a large cast of characters-Indian leaders, British officials, colonial governors, wealthy planters--and puts Bacon's rebellion in the wider context of a colonial population largely poor and restless, Protestant-Catholic animosity, and the politics of Indian nations' relations with the colonists and with one another."--<em>Publisher's Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Rice convincingly argues that this critical event in American history helped to create the Old South and the convergence of slavery, westward expansion, and issues of race. <em>Tales from a Revolution</em> compares favorably with Wilcomb E. Washburn's classic <em>The Governor and the Rebel</em>, which is now more than 50 years old...Any collection catering to scholars and fans of colonial American history will find this a worthy addition"--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Feminist Therapy (Theories of Psychotherapy Series�)</h2><p>In this second edition of her popular book, Laura S.

However, the importance of some discoveries is not always immediately understood. This was the case in 1901 when sponge divers retrieved a lump of corroded bronze from a shipwreck at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea near the Greek island of Antikythera. Little did the divers know they had found the oldest known analog computer in the world, an astonishing device that once simulated the motions of the stars and planets as they were understood by ancient Greek astronomers. Its remains now consist of 82 fragments, many of them containing gears and plates engraved with Greek words, that scientists and scholars have pieced back together through painstaking inspection and deduction, aided by radiographic tools and surface imaging. More than a century after its discovery, many of the secrets locked in this mysterious device can now be revealed. <br><br>In addition to chronicling the unlikely discovery of the Antikythera Mechanism, author Alexander Jones takes readers through a discussion of how the device worked, how and for what purpose it was created, and why it was on a ship that wrecked off the Greek coast around 60 BC. What the Mechanism has uncovered about Greco-Roman astronomy and scientific technology, and their place in Greek society, is truly amazing. The mechanical know-how that it embodied was more advanced than anything the Greeks were previously thought capable of, but the most recent research has revealed that its displays were designed so that an educated layman could understand the behavior of astronomical phenomena, and how intertwined they were with one's natural and social environment. It was at once a masterpiece of machinery as well as one of the first portable teaching devices. Written by a world-renowned expert on the Mechanism, <em>A Portable Cosmos</em> will fascinate all readers interested in ancient history, archaeology, and the history of science.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alexander Jones</strong> is Professor of the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity at New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World.<br><br>"[Jones] presents a very readable account of the Mechanism, and the consensus of what it was used for... [An] excellent 'User Manual.'" --<em>Journal of the British Astronomical Asso ciation</em><p></p><br>"Jones has, in short, produced a superb guide to this dazzling embodiment of ancient astronomical knowledge and mechanical technology. Detailed enough that even scholars of ancient science will learn much, yet readable enough that undergraduate students will find it approachable (I myself have tested out both audiences), this book ends the long wait for a thorough, reliable, and accessible guide to the Antikythera Mechanism." --Courtney Roby, Cornell University, in <em>Classical World</em><p></p><br>"The book is a triumph at several levels, as an account of high-grade detective work, as an exposition of ancient astronomical ideas, and as a disquisition on where those ideas fitted into the society that produced them.... This is recommended reading for anyone interested in ancient astronomy." --Geoffrey Lloyd, <em>Journal for the History of Astronomy</em><p></p><br>"This book will be invaluable to those engaged in the study of the science of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Endnotes and references will assist individuals who wish to delve into further research. The presented black-and-white photographs and drawings are essential to understanding the work's subject matter. ... Summing Up: Recommended. Graduate students, faculty, and professionals." --M. Dickinson, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Jones' book is written in such a way that makes it profitable reading for a wide range of readers, from the specialists on the Mechanism to those who have never heard of it. It presents in detail and explains clearly and in a pleasant way the Mechanism and its context by using all the existing specialised literature: this is really the Bible of the Antikythera Mechanism. The only recommendation to the unprepared reader is to use the book with moderation. One can easily become addicted to the Antikythera Mechanism, this absolute technical marvel of Antiquity, and dedicate oneself to the endless search for its lost planetary gear trains." --Efthymios Nicolaidis, <em>Almagest</em><p></p><br>"Jones's text, too, is precise but calm, elegant and with a certain charm. His learning is broad: here's Ptolemy, here are gear ratios, here's Cicero and Galen, Babylonians, planets, lunar months, Glauco, epicyclics and the 'Spindle of Necessity'. And it is not just the cosmos that is demonstrated, but the vast difference, and astonishing similarity, between us and our ancestors. So out of the history of science comes a sense of our humanity and the ancient desire to comprehend. God knows, it's timely, in the shrivelled cosmos we are building. We need more books like this. And probably more sponge-divers, too." --Michael Bywater, <em>The Spectator</em><p></p><br>"A historian of science and technology, Mr. Jones played a role in this endeavor. His job was to link the complexities of the Antikythera Mechanism to what the ancient Greeks believed about the astronomy of a geocentric universe. His virtue as an author is an exhaustive knowledge of his subject, such as how Greek calendars varied from city to city and how pre-Copernican astral calculations accounted for the mystery of the planets' retrograde motion...Mr. Jones can be refreshingly candid, avoiding scholarly habits of overcaution." --John J. Miller, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"<em>A Portable Cosmos</em> is a fine account of everything that pertains to the Antikythera mechanism-the story of its discovery and decipherment, the scholarly debates about its date and provenance, and the meanings it would have held for an ancient viewer. The book is notable for its sweep, and the ease with which it moves back and forth among ancient literature, the phenomena of astronomy, and the mechanical details of the surviving artifact. This is a gem of a book."-James Evans, University of Puget Sound<p></p><br>"My major contribution to this amazing lost-and-found story occurred when I was asked to referee a paper on the remarkable Antikythera Mechanism, which had been recovered from an ancient ship wreck. I told them, 'You should really ask Alexander Jones.' They did, and the unexpected result was that Jones, an outstanding scholar and an expert in both ancient Greek and antique astronomy, was invited to join the team. Here Jones describes the long and fascinating path to decipherment in the decades since the device was found by divers in 1900." -Owen Gingerich, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics<p></p><br>"Alexander Jones has done a huge service with <em>A Portable Cosmos</em>, dispelling many of the myths associated with this fascinating artifact... he has provided an engagingly written and detailed history of the Mechanism, covering the discovery itself, research undertaken to date, the ancient scientific and technological expertise underpinning the object and the cultural contexts of the Greco-Roman world in which it was made and meant to be used. Jones persuasively argues that the Mechanism was intended as an educational tool, rather than a specialist bit of kit...its intended audience may have been the ancient counterpart to those readers who will be drawn to Jones' authoritative and insightful account. A Portable Cosmos is set to become the definitive history of the Antikythera Mechanism, and will be of great value to specialists, as well as students and those interested in ancient Greco-Roman science and technology."-Liba Taub, University of Cambridge<p></p><br>"Alexander Jones' comprehensive look at the Antikythera mechanism and its context will suit readers interested in the mechanism or the history of science in general." - Publishers Weekly<p></p><br></p><h2>Clearing Spaces: Inspirational Techniques to Heal Your Home</h2><p>Out with the bad energy, in with the good!

This important collection synthesizes and presents broad swaths of work from poets of all races and backgrounds, as only Reed can, ranging from Gertrude Stein to Ai, from Bessie Smith to Askia Toure, from W. C. Handy to the little-known poetry of Ernest Hemingway. Through his unique position in American letters, as writer, teacher, and even publisher, Reed has an unparalleled working knowledge of many of the more marginalized voices in American poetry. This collection will reflect that unique access by including acknowledged masters as well as lesser known talents in greater variety than any previous anthology. From Totems to Hip Hop will cover American poetry from its pre-Columbian origins to the hip hop lyricists of today and, with the guidance of Reed's thoughtful and provocative introduction and headnotes, trace the remarkably rich cross-pollination which has continually occurred across racial and cultural lines.</p><p>Ishmael Reed, an accomplished and prolific poet, novelist, essayist, playwright, and editor, as well as a teacher and MacArthur fellow, rejects the idea of a narrow and calcified canon of American literature, asking, "Can you imagine where science would be had scientists refused to budge from accepted theories?" Indeed, American poetry is always a work-in-progress, and Reed's in-touch and open-minded approach in <i>From Totems to Hip-Hop</i> yields a dynamic and original anthology, an unprecedented amalgam of poets representing many facets of American culture and society. Even Reed's organizing categories are pertinent and stimulating: nature and place, men and women, family, politics, and heroes and sheroes, anti and otherwise. Within these arenas, readers will find poems by Sylvia Plath, Yusef Komunyajaa, Thulani Davis, Bob Holman, Jayne Cortez, Diane Glancy, Garrett Hongo, Charles Simic, Al Young, Nellie Wong, Tupac Shakur, and many others. Reed then sagely concludes with an invaluable selection of eloquent and challenging manifestos and poetic commentaries. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is not just another "nice recovery book"--one that you read and then put aside, hopefully taking away a few good thoughts. My intention is that the material offered here should be chewed, pulled apart, scrutinized, and internalized. This book is designed to be worked. It is intended to provide support, insights, and exercises that will do something about the high relapse rate of people starting recovery.&gt;-Earnie Larsen, From the introduction In this invaluable guide, renowned author and lecturer Earnie Larsen brings you a portable recovery aftercare program that you can easily integrate into your personal life ?and take with you anywhere you go.Now That You're Sober is an all-purpose, year-long compendium of recovery wisdom and inspiration to help those who are newly sober focus on practical applications of Twelve Step principles. Like a traditional aftercare program, it is designed to keep the basics of recovery front and center in your consciousness, as it is the loss of this awareness that causes relapse. In his characteristic down-to-earth, tell-it-like-it-is style, Larsen serves as your recovery coach, providing guidance and inspiration when you feel vulnerable in your sobriety, and helping you to move past common stumbling blocks and flourish in your daily life. Each of his fifty-two entries includes a motivational essay, or pep talk, centered on a key element of recovery, followed by personal, practical, actionable steps to help you refocus on the concepts and behaviors that are essential in a recovering person's life.Earnie Larsen is a nationally known pioneer in the field of recovery from addictive and unwanted behaviors.

She proposes an anthropology that is lived and written in a personal voice. She does so in the hope that it will lead us toward greater depth of understanding and feeling, not only in contemporary anthropology, but in all acts of witnessing.</p><p>In <i>The Vulnerable Observer,</i> Ruth Behar--ethnographer, essayist, editor, poet, and a professor of anthropology--challenges traditional theories and offers a more personal approach to anthropology in which the line between observer and observed is not so easily drawn and the observers themselves are not only visible, but vulnerable to their subjects. As she writes, "Call it sentimental, call it Victorian and nineteenth century, but I say that anthropology that doesn't break your heart just isn't worth doing anymore." These insightful, often poetic essays weave together memories of childhood as a Cuban Jewish immigrant with accounts of fieldwork in Spain, Cuba, and the United States. Along the way, Behar tirelessly investigates and elegantly communicates the "central dilemma of all aspects of witnessing." In her own words, "Are there limits--of respect, piety, pathos--that should not be crossed, even to leave a record?"Ruth Behar-ethnographer, essayist, editor, and poet-is professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

At its height in 1995, the Union Assembly included fifty-four churches spread across nineteen states. Spanning nearly a hundred years and three generations of family leadership and relying on hundreds of interviews with members and former members, David Cady&#x2019;s groundbreaking investigation begins, in 1917, with the Church&#x2019;s illiterate but magnetic founder, Charlie (C. T.) Pratt, summoning a congregation of resilient followers with little more than a flair for spectacle. As power dynamics stir within the maturing Church, Cady turns to C. T.&#x2019;s fourth son, Jesse, who conspires to wrest the Union Assembly from his five brothers and dismiss his own parents from the church they had created. Jesse dominated the Church with fear and a demand of total obedience from its nearly 15,000 members until his mysterious death at age fifty-six.<br><br> As Cady reveals, this event triggered a succession crisis in the Pratt-family ranks as Jesse&#x2019;s wife fostered her son Jesse Junior&#x2019;s rise to power and spurned other heirs presumptive to the Church. Jesse Junior turned out to be a tormented leader who drove his followers to the brink of poverty with an uncompromising demand that they give their all to God&#x2014;and to him. The church&#x2019;s fortune squandered and its future under threat, Jesse Junior&#x2019;s mother was finally forced to have her favored son removed and defrocked. For all its troubling twists and turns, Cady&#x2019;s chronicle ends with a minor miracle, as Jesse&#x2019;s younger brother, Charlie T. Pratt III, takes over leadership and manages to expel the oppressive air of authoritarianism from the body of the Church and hold the community together in the process.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>DAVID CADY</b> is the author of three novels: <i>The Handler, Fatal Option, </i>and <i>Severed. </i>Before his retirement, he taught high school science at Dalton High School in northwest Georgia.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;The story of the Church of God of Union Assembly&#x2014;the so-called Pratt Church&#x2014;is truly a fascinating one.

Twenty-five years ago a new German state came into being. How much do we really understand this new Germany, and how do its people understand themselves?<br><br>Neil MacGregor argues that, uniquely for any European country, no coherent, overarching narrative of Germany's history can be constructed, for in Germany both geography and history have always been unstable. Its frontiers have constantly shifted. K�nigsberg, home to the greatest German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, is now Kaliningrad, Russia; Strasbourg, in whose cathedral Wolfgang von Geothe, Germany's greatest writer, discovered the distinctiveness of his country's art and history, now lies within the borders of France. For most of the five hundred years covered by this book Germany has been composed of many separate political units, each with a distinct history. And any comfortable national story Germans might have told themselves before 1914 was destroyed by the events of the following thirty years.<br><br>German history may be inherently fragmented, but it contains a large number of widely shared memories, awarenesses, and experiences; examining some of these is the purpose of this book. MacGregor chooses objects and ideas, people and places that still resonate in the new Germany&#x2014;porcelain from Dresden and rubble from its ruins, Bauhaus design and the German sausage, the crown of Charlemagne and the gates of Buchenwald&#x2014;to show us something of its collective imagination. There has never been a book about Germany quite like it.</p></p><p><p>Neil MacGregor was Director of the National Gallery, London from 1987 to 2002 and of the British Museum from 2002 to 2015.

Where is it? / I do not know where to find such a country,&#x201d; wrote Goethe and Schiller in 1796. In Germany both geography and history have always been unstable. Borders move. The past keeps changing. Cities and regions which were for centuries German are now firmly parts of other countries. What does that mean for them, and for the Germans? For most of the 500 years covered by this book Germany has been composed of many separate political units, each with a distinct history. Enfeebling division, or enriching complexity? <br><br>1<br><br>The View from the Gate<br><br>If the modern state of Germany can be said to have a village green on which communal events are marked and celebrated, then it is the area around the Brandenburg Gate. It has long been Berlin&#x2019;s preferred setting for the city&#x2019;s meetings and rallies, but since the reunification of the two Germanys, the severe neo-classical gateway has become the natural backdrop to all great national events.<br><br>Professor Monika Gr�tters, the German Federal Minister of Culture, says:<br><br>&#x201c;It is the national monument. There is no other that can compete with it. It is of course the symbol of the Berlin Wall, of a world divided into East and West. And it is at the same time the symbol of the fall of that Wall and of liberty regained. It stands for the division of Germany, and the division of the world, into two blocs: two ideas of society. It reminds us of the loss of freedom; but it is in itself also the great symbol of freedom regained. It is the national and the international monument of freedom and unity.&#x201d;<br><br>Monika Gr�tters is talking about the meanings that all across the world have attached to the Brandenburg Gate since the Wall fell twenty-five years ago, but the history of the Gate, its own experiences and its far-reaching associations, go back ten times longer than that. <br><br>Originally the site of one of a number of gates around Berlin, at which customs dues were collected from goods wagons entering the city, it was rebuilt in the 1780s on the orders of the Prussian king, Frederick William II, to a grand neo-classical design by C. G. Langhans. Based on the gateway to the Acropolis, it was conceived as a monument to peace, and it was one of the first architectural signals that Berlin&#x2014;which under Frederick the Great had acquired a magnificent library, opera house and other similar institutions (see Chapter 30)&#x2014;now felt entitled to proclaim itself a cultural and intellectual city in the Athenian tradition.<br><br>The Brandenburg Gate stands at the western end of the long avenue Unter den Linden (Under the Lime Trees), which, rather like the Champs-Elys�es in Paris, runs from the edge of the city down to its very heart. At the end of the avenue, closing the vista, was the Stadtschloss, the palace of the Hohenzollern kings. Some time after the Gate was built, a bronze figure of Victory, her chariot drawn by four horses, was placed on top, giving it the appearance of a triumphal arch.<br><br>The first person actually to use it for a triumphal entry was not, however, the King of Prussia, but Napoleon Bonaparte. After the defeat of Austria at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805, the only German state still offering serious resistance to the invader was Prussia. But on 14 October of the following year, Napoleon humiliatingly routed the Prussian army at the battles of Jena and Auerst�dt. Two weeks later, on 27 October 1806, the French emperor entered Berlin in triumph, leading his troops through the Brandenburg Gate, marching them down Unter den Linden towards the palace of the king. The royal family fled to the eastern city of K�nigsberg (now Kaliningrad), where they began to plan Prussia&#x2019;s survival and recovery. Berlin was abandoned to French occupation. Napoleon, eager to demonstrate that his authority was now absolute and the Prussian king powerless in his own capital, removed the bronze quadriga from the top of the Gate and carried it away as a trophy, to be exhibited as war booty in Paris. For eight years the Brandenburg Gate was without its crowning sculpture.<br><br>In K�nigsberg the king and his advisers effected a complete reordering of the Prussian state, enabling it ultimately to take the leading part in resisting and expelling the French. In 1813, Prussian and Russian troops together forced Napoleon out of Berlin, and pursued him and his army all the way to Paris. In 1814, to scenes of public jubilation, the quadriga returned to the Brandenburg Gate. It was, however, modified before being reinstated. In the bronze chariot you see today, the statue of Victory is accompanied by the Prussian eagle, and her lance proudly bears the Iron Cross (see Chapter 14), the decoration awarded by the King of Prussia to those who had fought with valour against the French invader. The chariot makes clear that Napoleon had been defeated by a Germany which his invasion had largely created. The Gate had become a Prussian triumphal arch.<br><br>The Brandenburg Gate is not just a monument to which history has added layers of meaning. It is also a remarkable standpoint from which to view some of the key moments in German history. In fact, from this place alone, you can see evidence not just of the Napoleonic Wars, but of many other great events that have shaped the German national memory.<br><br>If you turn west and look along the broad avenue that leads to the royal palace at Charlottenburg, you see another figure of Victory, this time gilded and alone, standing on top of the 200-foot-high Siegess�ule (Victory Column), designed in 1864 to celebrate the Prussian victory over Denmark, which began the process of German unification. By the time it was finished, Prussia had also trounced the Austrians in 1866 and defeated the French in 1870 and the base was decorated accordingly to mark the triple triumph. Under Bismarck&#x2019;s guidance, the King of Prussia had become the German emperor, head of a united Germany which was the leading industrial and military power on the continent. The Victory Column&#x2019;s inauguration in 1873 signalled Berlin&#x2019;s new role in Europe and the world. In 1945 the French insisted on the removal of the sculpted plaques showing their defeat, but the column is otherwise broadly as intended, and still speaks today of the confident optimism of Berlin in the 1870s. <br><br>You could say that the westward view from the Brandenburg Gate is a view of Germany&#x2019;s place in the world as it actually was between 1870 and 1914. If things had gone as Hitler and Albert Speer had planned, the view north in the late 1940s would have shown their idea of what that place ought to be. Speer, Hitler&#x2019;s cherished architect, designed a colossal Volkshalle, a Hall of the People. An enormous dome, over 1,000 feet high, crowned the assembly room in which 180,000 people could gather to listen to the F�hrer. It would have dwarfed completely the nearby Reichstag, and been an uncomfortable, megalomaniac neighbour to the Brandenburg Gate, itself a favourite site for Nazi marches and rallies. It is a strange experience, to stand on the spot from which you would have seen Speer&#x2019;s dome, had history turned out differently, and from which if you turn south, you can today see the approaches to the Holocaust Memorial. <br><br>But the views west, north or south from the Brandenburg Gate were always intended to be secondary. In a virtuoso piece of urban scenography it was the view east that mattered, down Unter den Linden, past Frederick the Great&#x2019;s library and opera house, and on to the end of the vista and the Stadtschloss. The Schloss, a huge baroque city-palace, was completed around 1700 and effectively designed to make one great statement: after seventy years of turmoil, in spite of the Thirty Years&#x2019; War (1618&#x2013;48), in spite of Swedish invasion (in the 1670s), Brandenburg&#x2014;the modest state of which Berlin was the capital&#x2014;had not only survived, but had emerged as a serious European power.<br><br>Its survival was remarkable. It is reckoned that in the 1630s the urban population of Brandenburg declined from 113,500 to 34,000, while its rural inhabitants fell from 300,000 to 75,000. Something like three quarters of the population had died or fled. After the war, the position in both town and country was stabilized and prosperity slowly began to return. In the 1670s the Swedes, the great military power of northern Europe, had invaded again, in alliance with the French. The then Elector of Brandenburg, known to history as the Great Elector, had brilliantly outmanoeuvred and defeated them. In a pleasing twist of political and economic revenge, when Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and expelled the Protestants from France in 1685, many of the most educated and most skilled of the Huguenots came to work in, and to enrich, Berlin. Among them were some of the craftsmen who shaped and embellished the palace. The Stadtschloss told the world that you did not mess with Brandenburg.<br><br>But as you look down Unter den Linden today, you can&#x2019;t see it. Badly damaged by bombing, it survived the Second World War, and could well have been rebuilt. The Soviet authorities decided instead to bulldoze the Hohenzollern Schloss, which they regarded as the physical symbol of a Prussian militarism that they now had the opportunity to annihilate. Only one small part of it was preserved&#x2014;the balcony from which, on 9 November 1918, the Communist Karl Liebknecht had proclaimed the Free Socialist Republic of Germany, an attempt to create a Communist state which was rapidly crushed (see Chapter 22).<br><br>On the site of the old royal palace, the government of the German Democratic Republic built the new, modernist Palast der Republik, a steel structure clad in bronzed mirror-glass that was the seat of the People&#x2019;s Chamber and a centre for cultural and leisure activities until the GDR ended in 1990. But today you can&#x2019;t see that either. In the years after reunification there was intense debate about the proper future of the Palast der Republik in a new reunited Berlin, now that the people&#x2019;s representatives sat once again in the pan-German Reichstag. By 2008 the Palast der Republik had been demolished, allegedly because asbestos made it unfit for future use. With it disappeared many of the happier memories of old East Berlin. Its steel skeleton was sold and used to build the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. <br><br>Thus from the Brandenburg Gate today you can admire neither the triumph of the Great Elector nor the Socialist achievement of the German Democratic Republic. The historic vista now ends on a building site, where a reconstruction of the old Stadtschloss is rapidly taking shape (see Chapter 30). Behind it, though, still stands the other great monument of East Berlin, the thousand-foot-high Alexanderturm, a hi-tech telecommunications tower of the late 1960s designed to be unmissably visible in West Berlin and to broadcast, in every sense, the virtues of the Socialist state. Still one of the tallest buildings in Germany, it dominates the skyline across the city. Just below its summit is a spherical operations centre with the inevitable revolving restaurant. But that is not the reason why the Alexanderturm has become part of Berlin&#x2019;s world of memories. By a quirk of geometry and reflection, whenever the sun shone, there appeared on the sphere a large incandescent cross&#x2014;it still appears today and draws ironic smiles from the spectators at the Brandenburg Gate who remember the frustration and embarrassment the cross caused the atheist authorities in the GDR&#x2014;it was quickly dubbed &#x201c;the Pope&#x2019;s revenge.&#x201d;<br><br>Knocked about in the war, the Brandenburg Gate was patched up and repaired by the occupying authorities. Situated right on the boundary between the Western and Eastern zones (and later between the two states), it was one of the authorized crossing points. As in the eighteenth century, it again became an entrance to Berlin, taking on a particular, charged, significance as a place for demonstrations. In 1953 it was the scene of the first major rebellion against Soviet rule in Eastern Europe, as tens of thousands of striking workers called for free elections and tore down the red flag flying over it. The unrest was put down by Soviet tanks. On 14 August 1961, one day after the building of the Wall began, West Berliners gathered on the other side of the Gate to protest against the erection of the Wall and the division of their city. Using these demonstrations as a pretext, the East German authorities closed the checkpoint there &#x201c;until further notice.&#x201d; For twenty-eight years the Gate became a barrier. It did not reopen until 22 December 1989, when the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, walked through it to be greeted by the East German Prime Minister, Hans Modrow. There is no building or site that speaks so powerfully to Germans everywhere of the division and the reunification of their country.<br><br>Since reunification, the Brandenburg Gate has once again been renovated and is now at the centre of a pedestrianized zone, the gathering point of choice for celebrations of all sorts. And in the summer of 2014 it was once again used for a triumphal entry into the city&#x2014;not by a French invader, but by the German football team, returning victorious from the World Cup in Brazil.<br><br>In the next chapter I shall be going down Unter den Linden towards the east, to explore some of the memories of the Cold War division of Germany. It was so effective and profound that those who lived in East and West have few memories in common. What all do remember is the difficulty of travelling from one Germany to the other and the price paid by those who tried to do so without authorization.<br><br>2<br><br>Divided Heaven <br><br>The restored Reichstag, where the German Parliament meets, stands in the heart of Berlin. Because of its position near the former border dividing East and West Berlin, there are now few buildings near it and it is set between a meadow on one side, and the banks of the River Spree on the other. On most days, the riverside is busy with sightseers and strollers, such as you might find by the Seine or the Thames. But it quickly becomes obvious that this could not be either London or Paris; it could only be in Berlin. In various places beside the river are rows of white crosses. <br><br>g�nter litfen 24 august 1961<br><br>udo d�llick 5 october 1961 <br><br>hans r�wel 1 january 1963<br><br>klaus schr�ter 4 november 1963<br><br>heinz sokolowski 25 november 1965<br><br>marinetta jirkowsky 22 november 1980<br><br>It seems like a war cemetery, because all the dead were young. But it is not&#x2014;the names are of some of those who were killed trying to escape from East to West Berlin after the building in August 1961 of the most potent symbol of the Cold War: the Berlin Wall. The deaths range in date from ten days after the building of the Wall to ten months before its removal.</p><h2>The Anti-Estrogenic Diet: How Estrogenic Foods and Chemicals Are Making You Fat and Sick</h2><p><b>� Lower your risk of metabolic disorders, disease, and chronic weight gain</b><br><br><b>� Protect yourself against the estrogenic substances in the environment, products, water, and food</b><br><br><b><b>�&nbsp;</b>Learn how certain foods and herbs can protect you!</b><br><br>Estrogenic chemicals&#x2014;known for causing the near extinction of various living species&#x2014;are found in some of the most common foods we eat.<br><br>In this revolutionary diet book, Ori Hofmekler addresses the millions of overweight and obese individuals who have failed or are disappointed with other diets&#x2014;those who suffer from yoyo dieting, weight gain rebounds, or accumulation of stubborn fat in the belly and other estrogen-sensitive areas.

The entire community of Hemingway, South Carolina, shared responsibilities, helped raise all of the children, and worked side by side together every day in the bean fields. Perhaps most important, the community shared its food and recipes. When Sylvia set out to write this cookbook, she decided to hold a cook-off back home in Hemingway at Jeremiah Church. Family and friends of all ages shared their favorite dishes as well as their spirit and love for one another. The recipes offered at the cook-off were then compiled to create this incredible collection, along with many of Sylvia's and the Woods family's own recipes.<p>Here are the kinds of recipes you'd find if you visited the Woods family's home. Sylvia's daughter Bedelia is well known for her Barbecued Beef Short Ribs, which are as sassy and spicy as Bedelia herself. Kenneth, Sylvia's youngest son, has loved to fish ever since he was a child, spending his summers by the fishing hole in Hemingway. Now Kenneth's son, DeSean, enjoys fishing, too. Kenneth's Honey Lemon Tilefish, DeSean's favorite, is just one of Kenneth's special recipes presented here.</p><p>And there are many, many other wonderful dishes, too. In this remarkable cookbook, Sylvia has gathered more than 125 soul food classics, including mouthwatering recipes for okra, collard greens, Southern-style pound cakes, hearty meat and seafood stews and casseroles, salads, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and more. These recipes are straight from the heart of the Woods community of family and friends. Now Sylvia gives them to you to share with your loved ones. Bring them into your home and experience a little bit of Hemingway's soul.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Sylvia Woods, born in Hemingway, South Carolina, started the world-famous Sylvia's Restaurant in 1963 and opened a second restaurant in Atlanta in 1997. She owned a line of canned and bottled food products that is sold in supermarkets across the country.</p><b>The Absolute Best Southern Fried Chicken</b> <p>Makes 4 servings </p><p>My mother, Julia, made some of the best fried chicken in all of South Carolina. She had her secrets to making it crunchy on the outside but keeping it tender on the inside. First of all, she would always shake the chicken in the coating, never dredge it. Then she cooked the chicken in a deep layer of oil in a black iron pan. </p><p>Fried chicken was a dish that she made for holidays, and oftentimes for Sunday dinner. She also fried up a batch before sending the children anywhere by train, since fried chicken makes the most delicious sandwiches imaginable. She would put the chicken between two slices of white bread, which were covered with mayonnaise. The longer the chicken sandwiches sat, the better they tasted, since the crumblings from the chicken skin and the mayonnaise would soak into the soft white bread. My son, Kenneth, would sometimes just eat the bread by itself before eating the chicken, since it tasted so good. The sandwiches were packed into a shoebox with some fruit and maybe a piece of cake or pie. You were supposed to wait until lunchtime to eat the chicken sandwiches, but none of the kids could ever wait that long. Kenny tells the story like this: </p><p>"I can remember those chicken sandwiches that my grandmother would pack for me to take on the train back to New York. It was a long train trip, maybe thirteen hours, and Grandma would make sure to pack me plenty of food. I could hardly wait to get on the train and eat those sandwiches because the aroma would just come out of the box and grab my attention. And my stomach would start rumbling and my mouth would start watering. Grandma would be waving good-bye, tears in her eyes, and I wouldn't really be paying attention. Almost before the train pulled off, I would have torn open the box and have wrapped my mouth around a fried chicken sandwich. Boy they were great!" </p><p>One 3 1/2-pound chicken, cut into eighths<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 teaspoon paprika<br> 1 cup vegetable oil </p><p><b>1.</b> Rinse the chicken and pat dry. In a small bowl, combine the salt, 1 teaspoon of the black pepper, and the garlic powder. Sprinkle over the chicken. Let stand at least 20 minutes or, even better, overnight in the refrigerator. </p><p><b>2.</b> Place the flour, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and paprika into a plastic bag. Add the seasoned chicken and shake until each piece is covered with the flour. </p><p><b>3.</b> In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat until it bubbles when a little flour is sprinkled in. Add the chicken pieces and reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 7 to 10 minutes or until the chicken is nicely browned on the bottom. Turn and cook on the other side for 7 to 10 minutes or until cooked through. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels before serving. </p><p>---------------------------------------------------------- </p><p><b>Black-Eyed Pea Salad</b> </p><p>Makes 4 to 5 servings </p><p>Black-eyed peas have always been a part of our history and an important ingredient in soul food. In fact, when someone asks me what soul food is, I always name black-eyed peas first, along with collard greens, fried chicken, and barbecue. </p><p>Black-eyed peas originated in Asia and made their way to the West Indies and throughout the South, where they flourished in the warm fields. </p><p>When I was growing up, we ate black-eyed peas mostly in the winter. We always bought them dried, since they didn't grow plentifully in our fields as field peas and cow peas did. But every now and then, we'd find some black-eyed peas growing up the cornstalks with the other beans (sometimes the seeds get mixed together). Then we'd eat them fresh. This recipe is meant for the dried kind of pea, although these days it's easier to buy them already cooked in cans or frozen. Get them any way you like, but definitely make this spicy salad next time you need something to serve at a picnic or for a buffet. There's nothing better. </p><p>1 1/2 cups cooked or canned black-eyed peas<br> 3/4 cup chopped green bell pepper<br> 1/2 cup chopped celery<br> 1/2 cup chopped red onion<br> 1/4 cup chopped onion<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons cider vinegar<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce </p><p><b>1.</b> In a large bowl, combine the blackeyed peas, green pepper, celery, and both onions. </p><p><b>2.</b> In a small bowl, combine the oil, sugar, vinegar, garlic, salt, black pepper, and hot sauce. Pour the dressing over the beans. Toss. Let stand overnight for the flavors to meld.</p></p><h2>Major and Minor: Learn To Improvise Jazz in Every Key, Vol. 24 (book with 2 CDs)</h2><p>For all instrumentalists and vocalists.

In <i>Stepping Stones</i>, a book of interviews conducted by Dennis O&#x2019;Driscoll, Heaney acknowledged the significance of the poem to his writing, noting that &#x201c;there&#x2019;s one Virgilian journey that has indeed been a constant presence, and that is Aeneas&#x2019;s venture into the underworld. The motifs in Book VI have been in my head for years&#x2015;the golden bough, Charon&#x2019;s barge, the quest to meet the shade of the father.&#x201d;</p><p>In this new translation, Heaney employs the same deft handling of the original combined with the immediacy of language and the sophisticated poetic voice that were on show in his translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, a reimagining which, in the words of James Wood, &#x201c;created something imperishable and great that is stainless&#x2015;stainless, because its force as poetry makes it untouchable by the claw of literalism: it lives singly, as an English-language poem.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Seamus Heaney</b> (1939&#x2013;2013) received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995. His poems, plays, translations, and essays include <i>Opened Ground</i>, <i>Electric Light</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>, <i>The Spirit Level</i>, <i>District and Circle</i>, and <i>Finders Keepers</i>. Robert Lowell praised Heaney as the &#x201c;most important Irish poet since Yeats.&#x201d;<p>[Heaney's] voice carries the authenticity and believability of the plainspoken--even though (herein his magic) his words are anything but plainspoken. His stanzas are dense echo chambers of contending nuances and ricocheting sounds. And his is the gift of saying something extraordinary while, line by line, conveying a sense that this is something an ordinary person might actually say. &#x2015;Brad Leithauser, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"So fresh and compelling that those who have never enjoyed this classic may want to give it another try . . . Heaney deftly highlights the dramatic tension of the opening passages . . . The language Heaney employs&#x2015;a skillful mix of poetic phrasing and plainspokenness&#x2015;gives the narrative a wonderful immediacy . . . The result is an interpretation that shows why the ancient text is both timely and timeless."&#x2015;Elizabeth Lund, <i>The Washington Post</i></p><br><p>"The book as a whole is instilled with Heaney's mastery of music&#x2015;of rhythm, meter, and lineation . . . A remarkable and fitting epilogue to one of the great poetic careers of recent times."&#x2015;Nick Laird, <i>Harper's</i></p><p>"Seamus Heaney once wrote that Osip Mandelstam&#x2019;s translation of Dante&#x2019;s <i>Divine Comedy</i> 'possesses the poem as a musician possesses the score, both as a whole structure and as a sequence of delicious sounds.' The same could be said of Heaney&#x2019;s own translation of Book VI of the <i>Aeneid</i> . . . A lovely rendition of one of the most stylistically rich books of the <i>Aeneid</i>. Though he hews closer to the original Latin than in his other translations, Heaney&#x2019;s text is . . . a work of distinctive and poetic English." &#x2015;Christopher Carroll, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p></p><h2>The Kew Gardener&#39;s Guide to Growing Bulbs: The art and science to grow your own bulbs (Volume 5) (Kew Experts, 5)</h2><p><b>The new Kew guide to planting and cultivating bulbs features 12 easy and inspiring projects, detailed information on 66 of the most important species to grow, accompanied by Kew's beautiful botanical illustrations.</b><br> With <b>expert advice</b> from Kew bulb expert Richard Wilford and the Kew Gardens team, this is the ultimate companion to growing and planting with bulbs.<br> In this book Richard Wilford shows the key differences between <b>bulbs, corms and tubers</b>, he explains the importance of&nbsp;planting times and techniques, he explains simple methods for&nbsp;propagation, as well as&nbsp;planting instructions for growing in borders, within grassy areas or in containers.

This book provides a forum for thoughtful proponents of three principal evangelical views to state their case, respond to the others, and then provide a summary response and statement. Sinclair Ferguson sets out the case for infant baptism, Bruce Ware presents the case for believers&#39; baptism, and Anthony Lane argues for a mixed practice. As with any good conversation on a controversial topic, this book raises critical issues, challenges preconceptions and discloses the soft points in each view. Evangelicals who wish to understand better their own church&#39;s practice or that of their neighbor, or who perhaps are uncertain of their own views, will value this incisive book.</p><p><strong>David F. Wright</strong> (1937-2008) was professor of patristic and Reformation Christianity at New College, University of Edinburgh. Among his many published studies on historical and theological topics are several on baptism, including <em>What Has Infant Baptism Done to Baptism? An Enquiry at the End of Christendom.</em>"If you're undecided on when baptism is proper, or if your mind is made up but you want to understand why equally faithful Christians have an opposite position to yours, read <em>Baptism: Three Views.</em>" (Marvin Olasky, WORLD, August 15, 2009)<br><br>"Regardless of one's theological stance on baptism, the essays in this volume will serve to sharpen and challenge. . . This volume can be very helpful in a variety of venues and climates if people are willing to engage the issue openly and to give an honest hearing of divergent opinions." (Brian Allred, Mid-America Journal of Theology, October 2010)<br><br>"This book can help Christians understand their church's practice and the practice of other churches in baptism." (Roy B. Zuch, Bibiolotheca Sacra, April-June 2010)<br><br>"<em>Baptism</em> engages the reader by using etymological examples, contextual examples from Scripture, historical examples, and many other illustrations to draw conclusions, challenge preconceived notions, and point out weaknesses in each argument. The book is geared toward seminary students or pastors seeking to clarify their positions and better understand the positions of others, but is equally engaging for the average reader who has perhaps never fully investigated his personal beliefs on the subject. (Rachel Lonas, Pulpit Helps, August 2009)<br><br>"If one is looking for a good read on the issues surrounding believer's baptism versus infant baptism, with a hybrid third option thrown in for good measure, then <em>Baptism: Three Views</em> is a recommended place to start."

In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought.</p><p>In <i>Laches, Charmides,</i> and <i>Lysis,</i> Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. <i>Protagoras, Ion,</i> and <i>Meno</i> discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In <i>Gorgias,</i> Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The <i>Apology</i> (not a dialogue), <i>Crito, Euthyphro,</i> and the unforgettable <i>Phaedo</i> relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous <i>Symposium</i> and <i>Phaedrus,</i> written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. <i>Cratylus</i> discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the <i>Republic,</i> concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues <i>Euthydemus</i> deals with philosophy; metaphysical <i>Parmenides</i> is about general concepts and absolute being; <i>Theaetetus</i> reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, <i>Sophist</i> deals with not-being; <i>Politicus</i> with good and bad statesmanship and governments; <i>Philebus</i> with what is good. The <i>Timaeus</i> seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished <i>Critias</i> treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of <i>Laws</i> (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.</p></p><p><p>Sir Walter Rangeley Maitland Lamb (1882&#x2013;1961) lectured in Classics at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was Secretary of the Royal Academy of Arts.</p></p><h2>Dishing the Dirt: An Agatha Raisin Mystery (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, 26)</h2><p><p><i>Dishing the Dirt</i> continues the tradition in M.

Not only was this therapist romancing Agatha's ex-husband but she dug up details of Agatha's not-too-glamorous origins. Jill also counsels a woman, Gwen Simple, that Agatha firmly believes assisted her son in some grisly murders, although there is no proof. Not one to keep her feelings to herself, Agatha tells anyone that would listen that Jill is a charlatan and better off dead.

Nearly everyone has the impression that the difference in the wording between modern translations and the 1611 King James Bible is mainly due to synonym choices and language changes. Such is not the situation. The outrageous reason is that almost all translations since 1881 have been made from a drastically different Greek text than was used to prepare the older versions. The traditional Greek has been replaced! Dr. Jones digs deep into the truth of God&#39;s Word and separates the sheep from the goats.

She lives in Lee Summit, Missouri. Her first novel, &#39;Mutant Message Down Under&#39;, was a &#39;New York Times&#39; bestseller for thirty-one weeks and was published in twenty-four countries.Morgan's much-hyped first novel, a fictionalized account of a "walkabout" she took in the Outback with a group of Aborigines, gains from the use of authentic detail, although the storytelling is hindered by the author's heavy New Age agenda and incessant cultural proselytizing. A 50-ish alternative health practitioner from the American Midwest, Morgan was working with underprivileged Aborigine youths in the inner cities of Australia when a group of Aborigines offered her a chance to learn firsthand about their culture. Morgan's account of the tribe's customs, healing methods, food-finding tactics, etc. is absorbing, and her willingness to forgo Western luxuries and to relish the experience is courageous and touching. Less compellingly, the author claims that she was "chosen" by the Aborigines to tell the rest of humanity that the so-called "real people" are refusing to reproduce because of the ravages of Western civilization, and that Westerners have a limited time to clean up their act. Morgan's rudimentary writing skills are stretched to the limit, and she lessens the power of her story and its egalitarian lessons by adopting the perspective that Western culture is innately inferior to the naturalistic beliefs of the Aborigines. Still, with its high-powered package of New Age philosophy wrapped in an adventure narrative, this book may be the next Celestine Prophecy.

Over 1,600 photos and three hours of video clips make it easy to recognize poor handling methods that can cause behavior issues for a lifetime. Dr. Yin shows the wrong way, and then the right way, to clearly illustrate exactly how and why a pet reacts the way she does.<br><br>The benefits of low-stress handling are tremendous; practicing these refined handling skills will create a safer work environment, increase efficiency, and ultimately improve the bond between vet, pet, and client.<br></p><p>...the pictures on this book are amazing. The author has done an incredible job of accumulating 1,600 photographs of dogs and cats, along with a DVD, to illustrate &#x201c;techniques for developing patients who love their visits [to the veterinarian].&#x201d; In a time when dominance techniques often take center stage for controlling and managing behavior, it is a breath of fresh air to read the information contained [here]. It is science-based information (catalogued and referenced) ...will really assist veterinarians... the information included here will provide fodder for clinic training opportunities...interesting and enlightening. Nonthreatening techniques are provided with photographs to illustrate the outcome... the combination of reading the text and watching the DVD, with subsequent practice of the techniques, sets the stage for an in-clinic learning experience for all... contains gems on counterconditioning cats to pilling and veterinarian-supervised technician behavior modification sessions... I strongly recommend this book for veterinarians and veterinary technicians as well as for owners. Communicating with patients and pets is paramount for a strong and healthy bond... it is fantastic to be able to recommend a book solidly grounded in science instead of one full of outdated techniques.<br>&#x2013;Terry Marie Curtis, DVM, MS, DACVB, <i>JAVMA</i>, 15-Dec-2009<br><br>This fantastic tome belongs on every trainer&#x2019;s bookshelf, as well as in every veterinary clinic and shelter in America... the ultimate guide for new and experienced trainers and anyone who regularly deals with animals and who wants to learn about gentle, humane techniques... The DVD makes both an invaluable educational guide for yourself and can also be used to demonstrate specific behaviors to clients. If that&#x2019;s not enough, owning the book gives you access to information on Dr. Yin&#x2019;s Web site including PDF files of client handouts on behavior, and several entire chapters online...an incredibly useful avenue for broaching the subject of training and handling methods... If you buy one book this year on dog training and behavior, I urge you to consider Low Stress Handling, Restraint and Behavior Modification of Dogs &amp; Cats as your choice. While it priced higher than most books that trainers and behavior counselors will consider, it is well worth the price and you will find yourself referring to this book again and again, as well as using it with clients and other dog care professionals to discuss animal behavior and the benefits of using positive, low-stress methods.<br>&#x2013;Mychelle Blake, MSW, CDBC, <i>The APDT Chronicle of the Dog</i>, 01-Nov-2009</p><h2>Andromache, Hecuba, Trojan Women (Hackett Classics)</h2><p><p>Diane Arnson Svarlien's translation of Euripides' <i>Andromache</i>, <i>Hecuba</i>, and <i>Trojan Women</i> exhibits the same scholarly and poetic standards that have won praise for her <i>Alcestis</i>, <i>Medea</i>, <i>Hippolytus</i>.

From Rub�n Dar�o's quest to renew the Spanish language to C�sar Vallejo's linking of religion and politics, from Jorge Luis Borges's cosmopolitanism to Pablo Neruda's placement of poetry as uncompromising speaker for the downtrodden, and from Alejandra Pizarnik's agonies of the self to Humberto Ak'abal's examination of all things indigenous, it is through verse that the hemisphere's cantankerous collective soul in an age of overhaul might best be understood. </p><p>A brilliant, moving, and thought-provoking summation of these forking paths, <i>The FSG Book of Twentieth-Century Latin American Poetry </i>invites us to look at an illustrious literary tradition with fresh eyes. Ilan Stavans, one of the foremost scholars of Hispanic culture and a distinguished translator, goes beyond easy geographical and linguistic categorizations. This bilingual anthology features eighty-four authors from sixteen different countries writing in Spanish, Portuguese, Mapuche, Nahuatl, Quechua, Mazatec, Zapotec, Ladino, and Spanglish. The poems are rendered into English in inspired fashion by first-rate translators such as Elizabeth Bishop, Galway Kinnell, W. S. Merwin, Alastair Reid, Mark Strand, and Richard Wilbur. </p><p>In these pages the reader will experience the power of poetry to account for a hundred years in the life of a restless continent.</p></p><p><p><b>Ilan Stavans</b> is the Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture at Amherst College. His books, including <i>Art and Anger</i>, <i>Spanglish</i>,<i> On Borrowed Words</i>,<i> The Poetry of Pablo Neruda</i>, and<i> Becoming Amreicans</i>, have been translated into a dozen languages.</p><p>&#x201c;This ambitious anthology from critic and translator Stavans (<i>Dictionary Days</i>) attempts to introduce North American readers to the great strengths and the variety of Latin American modernity in verse. Beginning with the Cuban poet and patriot Jose Mart� (1853&#x2013;1895), Stavans's selection runs from the lushly formal nationalisms of a century ago (the Peruvian Jos� Santos Chocano: "I sing American, in its wild and autochthonous state... When I feel Incan, I honor that king,/ the Sun"), through the world-renowned intellect of Jorge Luis Borges, the expansive passions of Pablo Neruda, and the tender bleakness of the great Brazilian Carlos Drummond de Andrade, to a wealth of less famous, more recent poets. The volcanic odes of the Mexican Gloria Gevirtz ("The cages enclosing the perfumes, the limitless delights/ the voluptuousness of being born again and again") continue Neruda's visionary tradition, while the compressed bite of the Guatemalan Mayaquiche Humberto Ak'abal brings in another. While Stavans translates many poems himself, many more are reprinted from extant versions by famous names: Mark Strand, Elizabeth Bishop, Eliot Weinberger, Ursula K. Le Guin. Presented in facing-page format, Stavans's anthology inclines to the accessible; specialists may be frustrated by a few points, but Stavans aims, instead, to bring a whole tree of poems and traditions to U.S. readers who do not know it well.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publisher's Weekly (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;A great introduction in English to the vast diversity of 20th-century Latin American verse, often as innovative as the Latin American novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lawrence Olszewski, Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;I feel like a punching bag after reading this anthology; repeatedly walloped by the force of the original poems and again by the translations. I had never read Mexican poets Enrique Gonzalez Martinez or Amado Nervo but for me they are now linked with the vibrant translations written by Samuel Beckett. I used to think Afro-Cuban author Nicolas Guillen's "Negro Bembon" and "Tu no sabe ingle" were all about what gets lost in translation from Cuban Spanish to American English. No more. Cuban American novelist Achy Obejas has written a daring interpretation that sounds just right in English. But it is Ursula K. Le Guin who has written the best translation of the bunch. For best, I mean effective plus beautiful. Le Guin's translation of a dreamy Gabriela Mistral poem is so good that it's almost as if the American and Chilean writers sat down to write the same work from scratch in two languages at the same time. "The Sleep-Wave" and "La Ola Del SueNo" read as if they were destined to be twinned.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Luis Clemens, NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;Handsomely printed and designed, the collection has been astutely edited by Ilan Stavans, the prolific author and Amherst College professor who has done as much as anyone alive to bridge the hemisphere's linguistic gaps, and it boasts an all-star lineup of translators. In addition to Stavans they include W.S. Merwin, Richard Wilbur, Lysander Kemp, James Merrill, Robert Bly, Samuel Beckett and Ursula K. Le Guin. Many of the English-language versions that appear here, alongside the originals, are as good as we're likely to get for some time, perhaps ever. Most significantly, this hefty volume shows the ethno-linguistic breadth of what we lump under the monolithic term "Latin American" poetry. Like Walt Whitman's poetic Self, the bards of Latin America "contain multitudes." This volume includes works originally written not only in Spanish and Portuguese, but also in French, slangy Caribbean patois . . . and indigenous tongues, such as the Nahuatl of Mexican poet Natalio Hern�ndez Xocoyotzin and the Mapuche of the Chilean Elicura Chihuailaf . . . Poetry in Latin America is still serious business and, as this fine collection reminds us, valued sustenance.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Reed Johnson, Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Anthologies like this one are desperately necessary ... This anthology is alluring, seductive. It gives us a glimpse of a poetic tradition that, through translation, has bled across borders to soak into our own ... This anthology surpasses expectation. It is a book that will quickly become indispensable for studying poetry in Latin America in the twentieth century, and will certainly entice its students and readers to dive in to explore its riches.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Erica Mena, The Quarterly Conversation</i></p><p>&#x201c;A cornucopia of pleasures, some that come with a sapient sting, FSG's new bilingual anthology of Latin American poetry provides something for everyone in its great variety and generous, ecumenical selection ... the sweep and extravagance of mellifluous, unending lines ... create a daring trance seldom indulged in by English-language writers ... The varying styles of the translators ripple along pleasantly, as we enjoy the works that W.S. Merwin, Alastair Reid, Richard Wilbur, Stavans himself, and many others ... have produced over the years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lynne Lawner, The Brooklyn Rail</i></p><p>&#x201c;From introspection to protest, spirituality to eroticism, poets illuminate first cultures, colonialism, tyranny, war, liberation, and love over the course of the cataclysmic twentieth century, praising the beauty of the land and lamenting the elusiveness of justice.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Donna Seaman, Booklist, (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;The most important and exciting anthology to come out this year.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Shook, Molosseus</i></p><p>&#x201c;The reader dips into a dizzying array of styles, politics and obsessions originally expressed in various languages--Spanish, Portuguese, Quechua and Mazatec . . . For readers who can read the originals, the translations can open new meaning and subtlety . . . there is little to disagree with in the choices--of poets and their poems.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Felipe Nieves, The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></p></p><h2>Camp 4: Recollections of a Yosemite Rockclimber</h2><p><br><br>* Includes stories of such greats as Royal Robbins, Yvon Chouinard, Allen Steck, and Warren Harding<br><br>* Captures the raucous, outrageous, innovative spirit of climbing in Yosemite during this period<br><br>* Portrays the advances in equipment and style that revolutionized big-wall climbing<br>In the 1960's, California's Yosemite Valley was the center of the rock-climbing universe.

From Tomi Ungerer, one of the world's most famous and best-loved children's authors. Emile is an eight-legged hero who has twice as much courage and four times as many legs as most people &#x2013; except, of course, other octopuses. When deep-sea diver Captain Samovar is attacked by a ferocious shark, Emile comes to his aid. Grateful to his rescuer, the Captain invites him to stay at his home, where Emile sleeps in a bathtub full of salt water. Emile turns out to be a fantastic octopus: he is a gifted musician (able to play three instruments simultaneously) and a great lifeguard, teaching children to swim and saving people from drowning. One day, Emile and the Captain, who works on a police launch, encounter a suspicious-looking boat in the ocean, with a dangerous group of smugglers on board... A picture book for ages 5-8.</p><p>Born in Strasbourg, in the Alsace region of France, in 1931, Tomi Ungerer started drawing as a small boy. Growing up in Nazi-occupied Strasbourg, drawing caricatures was for him a form of resistance. Described on his school-leaving certificate as a &#39;depraved and rebellious character&#39;, he hitch-hiked around Europe, getting as far as Lapland, rather than going to university. Inspired by his heroes Saul Steinberg, James Thurber and Charles Addams, Ungerer landed in New York in 1956, with only $60 dollars in his pocket and a suitcase full of drawings. He quickly found success as an illustrator and caricaturist, becoming a star almost overnight. He published his first book for children, The Mellops Go Flying, in 1957, and went on to publish 80 books over the next ten years, covering all aspects of his work. Fluent in French, German and English, Ungerer regards himself as Alsatian first and European second, and has described New York City, where he lived and worked for 15 years, as the love of his life. However, his firmly held and clearly expressed beliefs and opinions - against racism, McCarthyism, the Vietnam War, against hypocrisy in any form - made life in the US increasingly difficult, and for a while, his books were banned from any libraries receiving public funding. He left the US in 1971 on a sudden impulse, when he and his second wife Yvonne moved to a farm in Nova Scotia, where they raised sheep, pigs and goats for a number of years, before moving to Ireland to raise their family. Tomi Ungerer now divides his time between his farm in Ireland, near the ocean that he loves, and Strasbourg, the city of his birth, where a museum dedicated to his work opened in late 2007.<p>"...One of the great fabulists and weirdoes of children's book illustration."&#x2014;<i>Wonderland</i></p><p>"This swashbuckling adventure featuring an intrepid octopus brings to mind two 20th-century greats: Jean de Brunhoff's "Babar" and H.A.

In an era dominated by the mass media and a proliferation of images, her work is a testament to the meaning and potency of painting. Dumas draws on her expansive visual archive and the nuances of language to create intense, psychologically charged works which explore themes such as sexuality, love, death and guilt, often referencing art history and current affairs. Her paintings and drawings are characterized by their extraordinary expressiveness and sometimes controversial subject matter. This fully illustrated exhibition catalogue accompanies the major exhibition at the Tate Modern, the Stedelijk Museum and the Fondation Beyeler. Surveying the artist's oeuvre from the mid-70s to the present, it features over 100 of her most important paintings and drawings alongside lesser-known works from the early period of her career </p><p>The book also includes a new interview with the artist; extracts from previously published but lesser-known texts (some available in English for the first time); and a new short story from prize-winning author Colm T�ib�n written in response to the paintings.

Polish army officer Witold Pilecki volunteered to be arrested by the Germans and reported from inside the camp.

The authors look beyond the jokes, the crudeness, the attacks on society and see a clever display of irony, social criticism, and philosophical thought. The writers begin with an examination of the characters. Does Homer actually display Aristotle&#x2019;s virtues of character? In what way does Bart exemplify American pragmatism? The book also examines the ethics and themes of the show, and concludes with discussions of how the series reflects the work of Aristotle, Marx, Camus, Sartre, and other thinkers.</p><p>No doubt Aristotle just rolled over in his grave. An essay called "Homer and Aristotle" would appear to be a treatise on two ancient Greek thinkers; in this case, it's a depiction of Homer Simpson's Aristotelian virtues. Raja Halwani's "Homeric" essay is amusing, though, and moreover, it actually ends up being enlightening, especially for those just learning Aristotle's ethics. Bart may be a Nietzschean without knowing it; Mr. Burns is a cipher for unhappiness (except when he eats "so-called iced-cream"); and Ned Flanders raises questions about neighborly love. <i>The Simpsons and Philosophy</i> has a lot to say about <i>The Simpsons</i>, and even more to say about philosophy. <p> The book collects 18 essays into an unpretentious, tongue-in-cheek, and surprisingly intelligent look at philosophy through the lens of Matt Groening's vaunted animated series. The editors are quick to point out that they don't think <i>The Simpsons</i> "is the equivalent of history's best works of literature ... but it nevertheless is just deep enough, and certainly funny enough, to warrant serious attention." The writers of the book are mostly professional philosophers, and they are appropriately erudite. But what is truly astonishing, even for a confessed <i>Simpsons</i> addict, is their breadth of <i>Simpsons</i> knowledge, spanning all 12 seasons of the show's history. <i>The Simpsons and Philosophy</i> is obviously not intended to be a turning point in modern thought, but it is an excellent introduction to some core elements of philosophy. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>William Irwin is professor of philosophy at King&#39;s College, Pennsylvania.

But do you think it is easy for a dog to pack a small brown suitcase, put on a beret, and hop on a plane? Ha! No one will buy Max&#x2019;s poems, so without money he must stay put. But living in New York City isn&#x2019;t so bad. Where else could he have friends like Bruno, with his invisible paintings, or Marcello, who builds upside down houses? And where else could he drop in at Baby Henry&#x2019;s Candy Shop? It&#x2019;s all possible in New York, a jumping jazzy city. And for Max, it&#x2019;s a dog&#x2019;s life that only Maira Kalman could invent.</p><p><b>Maira Kalman </b>is an illustrator, author, and designer.

This was unusual, because there was nothing down there&#x2014;according to the maps, the nearest land in this part of the Pacific was an atoll 500 klicks to the east.<br><br>Then the rear loading ramp of the Combat Talon rumbled open and several dozen tiny figures issued out from it in rapid sequence, spreading out into the sky behind the soaring plane.<br><br>The forty-strong flock of paratroopers plummeted to earth, men in high-altitude jumpsuits&#x2014;full-face breathing masks; streamlined black bodysuits. They angled their bodies downward as they fell, so that they flew head-first, their masks pointed into the onrushing wind, becoming human spears, freefalling with serious intent.<br><br>It was a classic HALO drop&#x2014;high-altitude, low-opening. You jumped from 37,000 feet, fell fast and hard, and then stopped dangerously close to the ground, right at your drop zone.<br><br>Curiously, however, the forty elite troops falling to earth today fell in identifiable subgroups, ten men to a group, as if they were trying to remain somehow separate.<br><br>Indeed, they were separate teams.<br><br>CRack teams.

Schofield, call-sign &#x201c;ScareCRow.&#x201d;<br><br>Behind his HALO mask, Schofield had a rugged CReased face, black hair and blue eyes. Slicing down aCRoss those eyes, however, were a pair of hideous vertical scars, one for eACH eye, wounds from a mission-gone-wrong and the source of his operational nickname. Once on the ground, he&#x2019;d hide those eyes behind a pair of reflective wraparound anti-flash glasses.<br><br>Quiet, intense and when necessary deadly, Schofield had a unique reputation in the Marine Corps. He&#x2019;d been involved in several missions that remained classified&#x2014;but the Marine Corps (like any group of human beings) is filled with gossip and rumor. Someone always knew someone who was there, or who saw the medical report, or who cleaned up the aftermath.<br><br>The rumors about Schofield were many and varied, and sometimes simply too outrageous to be true.<br><br>One: he had been involved in a gigantic multiforce battle in Antarctica, a battle which, it was said, involved a bloody and brutal confrontation with two of America&#x2019;s allies, France and Britain.<br><br>Two: he&#x2019;d saved the President during an attempted military coup at a remote USAF base. It was said that during that misadventure, the ScareCRow&#x2014;a former pilot&#x2014;had flown an experimental space shuttle into low earth orbit, engaged an enemy shuttle, destroyed it, and then come <i>back</i> to earth to rescue the President.<br><br>Of course none of this could possibly be verified, and so it remained the stuff of legend; legends, however, that Schofield&#x2019;s new unit were acutely aware of.<br><br>That said, there was one thing about Shane Schofield that they knew to be true: this was his first mission back after a long layover, four months of stress leave, in fact. On this occasion someone really <i>had</i> seen the medical report, and now all of his men on this mission knew about it.<br><br>They also knew the cause of his stress leave.<br><br>During his last mission out, Schofield had been taken to the very edge of his psychological endurance. Loved ones close to him had been captured . . . and executed. It was even said in hushed whispers that at one point on that mission he had tried to take his own life.<br><br>Which was why the other members of his team today were slightly less-than-confident in their leader.<br><br>Was he up to this mission? Was he a time-bomb waiting to explode? Was he a basketcase who would lose it at the first sign of trouble?<br><br>They were about to find out.<br><br>AS HE shot downward through the sky, Schofield recalled their mission briefing earlier that day.<br><br>Their target was Hell Island.<br><br>Actually, that wasn&#x2019;t quite true.<br><br>Their target was the aging supercarrier parked at Hell Island, the USS <i>Nimitz,</i> CVN-68.<br><br>The problem: soon after it had arrived at the isolated island to pick up some special cargo, a devastating tsunami had struck from the north and all contact with the <i>Nimitz</i> had been lost.<br><br>The oldest of America&#x2019;s twelve <i>Nimitz</i>-class carriers, the <i>Nimitz</i> had been heading home for decommissioning, with only a skeleton CRew of 500 aboard&#x2014;down from its regular 6,000. Likewise, its Carrier Battle Group, the cluster of destroyers, subs, supply ships and frigates that normally accompanied it around the globe, had been trimmed to just two CRuisers.<br><br>Contact with the two escort boats and the island&#x2019;s communications center had also been lost.<br><br>Unfortunately, the unexpected tidal wave wasn&#x2019;t the only hostile entity in play here: a North Korean nuclear submarine had been spotted a day earlier coming out of the Bering Sea. Its whereabouts were currently unknown, its presence in this area suspicious.<br><br>And so a mystery.<br><br>Equally suspicious to Schofield, however, was the presence of the other special operations units on this mission: the 82nd, the SEALs and Delta.<br><br>This was exceedingly odd. You never mixed and matched special ops units. They all had different specialties, different approACHes to mission situations, and could easily trip over eACH other. In short, it just wasn&#x2019;t done.<br><br>You added all that up, Schofield thought, and this smelled suspiciously like an exercise.<br><br>Except for one thing.<br><br>They were all carrying live ammunition.<br><br>Hurtling toward the world, freefalling at terminal velocity, bursting out of the cloudband . . .<br><br>. . . to behold the Pacific Ocean stretching away in every direction, the only imperfection in its surface: the small dot of land that was Hell Island.<br><br>A gigantic rectangular gray object lay at its western end, the <i>Nimitz.</i> Not far from the carrier, the island featured some big gun emplacements facing south and east, while at the northeastern tip there was a hill that looked like a mini-volcano.<br><br>A voice came through Schofield&#x2019;s earpiece. &#x201c;<i>All team leaders, this is Delta Six. We&#x2019;re going for the eastern end of the island and we&#x2019;ll work our way back</i><i>to the boat. Your DZ is the flight deck: Airborne, the bow; SEALs, aft; Marines, mid-section.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>Just like we were told in the briefing,</i> Schofield thought.<br><br>This was typical of Delta. They were born show-ponies. Great soldiers, sure, but glory-seekers all. No matter who they were working with&#x2014;even today, alongside three of the best special forces units in the world&#x2014;they always assumed they were in charge.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Roger that, Delta leader,&#x201d;</i> came the SEAL leader&#x2019;s voice.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Copy, Delta Six,&#x201d;</i> came the Airborne response.<br><br>Schofield didn&#x2019;t reply.<br><br>The Delta leader said, &#x201c;<i>Marine Six? ScareCRow? You copy?&#x201d;</i><br><br>Schofield sighed. &#x201c;I was at the mission briefing, too, Delta Six. And last I noticed, I don&#x2019;t have any short-term memory problems. I know the mission plan.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Cut the attitude, ScareCRow,&#x201d;</i> the Delta leader said. His name was Hugh Gordon, so naturally his call-sign was &#x201c;Flash.&#x201d; &#x201c;<i>We&#x2019;re all on the same team here.&#x201d;</i><br><br>&#x201c;What? <i>Your</i> team?&#x201d; Schofield said. &#x201c;How about this: how about you don&#x2019;t break radio silence until you&#x2019;ve got something important to say. ScareCRow, out.&#x201d;<br><br>It was more important than that. Even a frequency-hopping enCRypted radio signal could be caught these days, so if you transmitted, you had to assume someone was listening.<br><br>Worse, the new French-made Signet-5 radio-wave decoder&#x2014;sold by the French to Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria and other fine upstanding global citizens&#x2014;was specifically designed to seek out <i>and locate</i> the American AN/PRC-119 tactical radio when it was broadcasting, the very radio their four teams were using today. No one had yet thought to ask the French why they had built a locater whose only use was to pinpoint American tactical radios.<br><br>Schofield switched to his team&#x2019;s private channel. &#x201c;Marines. Switch off your tac radios. Listening mode only. Go to short-wave UHF if you want to talk to me.&#x201d;<br><br>A few of his Marines hesitated before obeying, but obey they did. They flicked off their radios.<br><br>The four clusters of parACHutists plummeted through the storm toward the world, zeroing in on the <i>Nimitz,</i> until a thousand feet above it, they yanked on their ripcords and their chutes opened.<br><br>Their superfast falls were abruptly arrested and they now floated in toward the carrier. The Delta team landed on the island itself, while the other three teams touched down lightly and gracefully on the flight deck of the supercarrier right in their assigned positions&#x2014;fore, mid and aft&#x2014;guns up.<br><br>They had just arrived in Hell.<br><br>RAIN HAMMERED down on the flight deck.<br><br>Schofield&#x2019;s team landed one after the other, unclipping their chutes before the great mushroom-shaped canopies had even hit the ground. The chutes were whipped away by the wind, leaving the ten Marines standing in the slashing rain on the flight deck, holding their MP-7s pointed outwards.<br><br>One after the other, they ripped off their face-masks, scanned the deck warily.<br><br>Schofield shucked his facemask and donned his signature silver wraparound glasses, masking his eyes. He beheld the deck around them.<br><br>The entire flight deck was deserted.<br><br>Except for the other teams that had just landed on it, not a soul could be seen. A few planes sat parked on the runways, some Tomcats and Hornets, and one chunky CH-53 Super Stallion helicopter.<br><br>There were star-shaped blood splatters on all of them, and also on the deck itself. But no bodies. Not one.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; Schofield said to his number two, &#x201c;what do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do I think?&#x201d; the bulky female Marine to his right replied. &#x201c;I think this is seriously fucked up. I was planning on spending this weekend watching David Hasselhoff DVDs. No one takes me away from the Hoff.&#x201d;<br><br>Gena Newman was her real name, Gunnery Sergeant was her rank, but &#x201c;Mother&#x201d; was her call-sign and it didn&#x2019;t relate to any overtly maternal traits. It was short for a slightly longer word starting with &#x201c;Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>At six-feet-two, 200 pounds, and with a fully-shaven head, Mother cut a mean figure. Tough, no-nonsense and fiercely loyal, she had accompanied Schofield on many missions, including the bad ones. She was also arguably the best Gunny in the Corps&#x2014;once she had even been offered her pick of assignments <i>outside</i> Schofield&#x2019;s command. She&#x2019;d looked the Commandant of the Marine Corps in the eye and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying with the ScareCRow, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother gazed at the blood splatters on a nearby plane. &#x201c;No, this was way suspect from the start. I mean, why are we here with D-boys, Airbornes and slithery SEALs? I&#x2019;d rather just work with swordsmen.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Swordsman</i> was her word for a Marine: a reference to the swords they wore with their full-dress uniforms.<br><br>&#x201c;Marines,&#x201d; Schofield called, &#x201c;the tower. Let&#x2019;s move.&#x201d;<br><br>Since they&#x2019;d been assigned the mid-section of the supercarrier, Schofield&#x2019;s Marines had the task of investigating the carrier&#x2019;s six-story-high command tower, known as &#x201c;the Island.&#x201d; But since this mission also involved a real island, it was being referred to today as &#x201c;the tower.&#x201d;<br><br>They moved quickly through the rain, CRossed the wide flight deck, arrived at the base of the tower&#x2014;to find the main door there covered in blood and about a million bullet holes. It hung askew, its hinges blasted.<br><br>Looking up, Schofield saw that every single antenna and radar array atop the command tower had been broken or destroyed. The main antenna mast was broken in the middle and now lay tilted over.<br><br>&#x201c;What in God&#x2019;s name happened here?&#x201d; one of Schofield&#x2019;s Marines asked softly. He was a big guy, broad-shouldered, with a super solid footballer&#x2019;s neck. His name: Corporal Harold &#x201c;Hulk&#x201d; Hogan.<br><br>&#x201c;Not a tsunami, that&#x2019;s for sure,&#x201d; Sergeant Paulo &#x201c;Pancho&#x201d; Sanchez said. Older and more senior than Hulk, he was a sly sarcastic type. &#x201c;Tsunamis don&#x2019;t shoot you in the head.&#x201d;<br><br>The voice of the SEAL leader came through their earpieces: <i>&#x201c;All units, this is Gator, Starboard Elevator Three has been disabled. We&#x2019;re taking the stairs, heading for the main hangar bay below the flight deck.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;This is Condor,&#x201d;</i> the Airborne leader called in. <i>&#x201c;I got evidence of a firefight in the SAM launcher bay up at the bow. Lot of blood, but not a single body . . .&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Delta Six here. We&#x2019;re on the island proper. No sign of anything yet . . .&#x201d;</i><br><br>Schofield didn&#x2019;t send out any report.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; Sanchez said to him. &#x201c;You gonna call in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>Sanchez exchanged a quick look with the Marine next to him, a tall guy named Bigfoot. Sanchez was one of the men who&#x2019;d been dubious about Schofield&#x2019;s mental state and his ability to lead this mission.<br><br>&#x201c;Not even to tell the others where we are?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But what about&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sergeant,&#x201d; Schofield said sharply, &#x201c;did you ask your previous commander to explain everything to you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So don&#x2019;t start doing it now. Focus on the mission at hand.&#x201d;<br><br>Sanchez bit his lip and nodded. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, if no one else has anything to say, let&#x2019;s take this tower. Move.&#x201d;<br><br>Hurdling the twisted steel door, they charged into the darkness of the supercarrier&#x2019;s command tower.<br><br>UP A series of tight ladders that formed the spine of the command tower, moving quickly.

Sixty years ago a goatee beard would have gotten you beat up in a lot of places. Chin fuzz was the symbol of the Beats or Beatniks, a mid-century, marginal group who pioneered a new kind of lifestyle. Their approach to life was hedonistic, experiential, fluid, and individualistic. Their contradictory approach to spirituality combined a search for God with a search for 'kicks'.<br>&nbsp; <br>In 1947, these Beatnik heroes set out on a road trip across America re-writing the "life-script"; of all future generations. Theirs was a new kind of lifestyle for a secular age. Their lives then (like so many of our lives now) were built upon experience, pleasure, mobility and self-discovery. They would also model a new approach to faith: desiring Christ, while still pursuing a laundry list of vices. Yet this dream would turn into a nightmare and the open road would lead back to an ancient half-forgotten path.<br><br> This was a path trodden by millions of feet over thousands of years. It was a path that began with a single step of faith as a pilgrim named Abraham stepped away from a cynical culture. A path of devotion that would lead to a cross on a hill named Golgotha.</p><p><p><b>We follow the culture of the road </b></p><p><b>because it is everywhere.</b></p><p>There&#x2019;s no shortage of prescriptions for restlessness out there: <i>Seek adventure. Live your life. Don&#x2019;t hold back.</i></p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Like the characters in a Jack Kerouac novel, we&#x2019;ve dirtied the dream of white picket fences with exhaust fumes. The new dream is the open road&#x2014;and freedom. </p><p>Yet we still desire the solace of faith. We like the concept of the sacred, but unwittingly subscribe to secularized, westernized spirituality. We&#x2019;re convinced that there is a deeper plot to this thing called life, yet watered-down, therapeutic forms of religion are all we choose to swallow, and our personal story trumps any larger narrative.</p><p>This is the non-committal culture of the road. Though driving on freely, we have forgotten where we&#x2019;re headed. </p><p>Jesus said His road is narrow. He wasn&#x2019;t some aimless nomad.

He is the author of the best&#x2013;selling book, Nine O'Clock in the Morning, and the co&#x2013;author of the charismatic classic, The Holy Spirit and You. Reverend Bennett and his wife, Rita, founded the Christian Renewal Association in Edmonds, Washington.<br><br>God is exciting and wonderful, and knowing Him is what life is all about. In spite of this, for many people, even if they've accepted Jesus, Christianity is not exciting at all. This is because, although the Spirit of God may be living in them, He's still locked up inside. (From the Introduction, by Dennis Bennett)<br><br>Throughout the late 20th century, the joy and freedom of the Holy Spirit has been released in a spectacular way in the historic churches. Over that time, Dennis Bennett has prepared and prayed with at least twenty&#x2013;five thousand people for the release or baptism of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>As one of the pioneers and leaders of this great renewal, Bennett is uniquely qualified to present this on the job handbook for those who are seeking to release the power of the Holy Spirit in their own lives and others. <br><br>This practical, comprehensive manual answers the questions that are the most often asked about the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and shows you how to prepare and guide others for this release. Reverend Bennett shows you how to be more effective in this ministry by first preparing yourself, and then following time&#x2013;tested, orderly guidelines for leading others into the exciting, full life of the Spirit.</p><p>Reverend Dennis Bennett (1917&#x2013;1991) was born in England on October 28, 1917, the son of a Congregational minister. In 1949, he was ordained into the Congregational church, but in 1952 became ordained as an Episcopal priest. He was "prominently identified with the charismatic renewal from the beginning.The movement is usually dated from the Sunday morning in 1959 when Bennett announced to his congregation in Van Nuys, California, that he had been baptized with the Holy Spirit and had spoken in tongues. As a result, a small opposition group in the congregation challenged him to cease and desist from what later came to be called charismatic experiences. He voluntarily resigned his pastorate, feeling that he did not have adequate understanding to defend his position. In 1960, he accepted an invitation to become vicar of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Seattle, Washington. Within six years the little mission church had become a strong parish. For a decade it was a major center from which word of baptism with the Holy Spirit would spread worldwide, especially in the mainline denominations. Thousands of people experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit as a result of hearing Bennett's testimony.</p><h2>A Gardener&#39;s Alphabet</h2><p>Revealing the variety of life underground, the bright comfort of a greenhouse on a winter&#x2019;s day, or the anticipation of starting seeds indoors in early spring, this striking alphabet book celebrates the simple joys of gardening. Without neglecting the frustrations&#x2014;the nibbling critters and the toil&#x2014;or wry, humorous moments spent in the garden. Mary Azarian&#x2019;s spare words and lovely woodcuts capture the essence of turning a bare plot of ground into fragrant flowers and lush vegetables and trees. Her depictions of insects, manure, and compost piles are as delightful as her fountains, pumpkins, and Queen Anne&#x2019;s lace. Whether we are young or old, our gardens both exhaust and renew us. They are our source of magic and wonder and perhaps our best way to live closer to the land and to the rhythm of the seasons.</p><p>Caldecott Medalist Mary Azarian is a consummate gardener and a skilled and original woodblock artist. Many of her prints are heavily influenced by her love of gardening, and her turn-of-the-century farmhouse is surrounded by gardens that reveal an artist&#39;s vision. Mary Azarian received the 1999 Caldecott Medal for SNOWFLAKE BENTLEY, written by Jacqueline Briggs Martin. She lives, skis, and gardens in Vermont.Kindergarten-Grade 2-True, there are great numbers of alphabet books, but when they are works of art they rise beyond teaching the letters. A Gardener's Alphabet is one of these. Azarian leads readers into the book with a two-page introduction that explains the importance of gardens in her life. The alphabet then begins, with one full-page illustration for each letter. The featured letter does not stand alone, but begins one word: "ARBOR," "BULBS," "COMPOST." The words are a mixture of nouns ("LAWN ORNAMENTS," "QUEEN ANNE'S LACE"); verbs ("DIG," "NIBBLE"); and types of gardens ("JAPANESE GARDEN," "KITCHEN GARDEN"). Words that may be unfamiliar to most children are not explained, e.g., "TOPIARY" and "XERISCAPE." The stunning black woodcuts, hand tinted with strong watercolors, are full of action and detail, showing men, women, and child gardeners with their tools and the rewards of their labors, with small creatures visible here and there. Each page can inspire conversation between an adult and child who may then do some gardening of their own.<br><i>Carolyn Jenks, First Parish Unitarian Church, Portland, ME </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heidegger: An Introduction</h2><p>Richard Polt provides a lively and accessible introduction to one of the most influential and intellectually demanding philosophers of the modern era. Covering the entire range of Heidegger&#39;s thought, Polt skillfully communicates the essence of the philosopher, enabling readers, especially those new to his writings, to approach his works with confidence and insight. Polt presents the questions Heidegger grappled with and the positions he adopted, and also analyzes persistent points of difference between competing schools of interpretation. The book begins by exploring Heidegger&#39;s central concern, the question of Being, and his way of doing philosophy. After considering his environment, personality, and early thought, it carefully takes readers through his best-known work, Being and Time. Heidegger concludes with highlights of its subject&#39;s later thought, providing guidelines for understanding Contributions to Philosophy and other important texts. It gives special attention to the philosopher&#39;s political involvement with the Nazis in the 1930s, indicating the strengths and weaknesses of the reactions to his politics, reactions ranging from exculpation to complete condemnation.</p><p><p> Richard Polt is Professor of Philosophy at Xavier University, Cincinnati. He is the author of <em>Heidegger: An Introduction</em> and <em>The Emergency of Being</em>, both from Cornell.</p>"Provides interesting details on Heidegger's biography and political life and surveys some of the philosopher's later writings."&#x2015;Publishers Weekly<br><br>"Polt has written a valuable introduction for beginners to Heidegger. . . Polt encourages the reader to try Heidegger's ideas on for size, and to judge them accordingly. Heidegger's philosophy comes to life in this little book. Highly recommended for all levels."&#x2015;Choice<br><br>"Polt negotiates the difficult path between introduction and over-simplification skilfully. Heidegger: An Introduction succeeds in making the philosopher's thought accessible without rendering it simplistic."&#x2015;Neil Levy, Philosophy in Review. February-December, 1999.<br><br>"This book is without a doubt the best general introduction to Heidegger ever written. Richard Polt has an uncanny ability to present Heidegger's central ideas in a straightforward way without sacrificing any of their richness or novelty. With his exceptional mastery of German, his concise formulations, and his sensitive, almost poetic style, Polt brings the philosopher's work to life. An incomparable achievement."&#x2015;Charles Guignon, editor of The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger</p><h2>The Pleasures Of Loving God: A call to accept God&#39;s all-encompassing love for you</h2><p>Here&#x2019;s an ultimate portrait of a loving Father, one to whom we can come for a fresh supply of truth and beauty, day by day.

The governesses, however, seem to spend more time running around in a state of frenzied desire than attending to the children&#x2019;s education. One of their main activities is lying in wait for any passing stranger, and then throwing themselves on him like drunken Maenads. The rest of the time they drift about in a kind of sated, melancholy calm, spied upon by an old man in the house opposite, who watches their goings-on through a telescope. As they hang paper lanterns and prepare for the ball in their own honor, and in honor of the little boys rolling hoops on the lawn, much is mysterious: one reviewer wrote of the book&#x2019;s &#x201c;deceptively simple words and phrasing, the transparency of which works like a mirror reflecting back on the reader.&#x201d;<br><br> Written with the elegance of old French fables, the dark sensuality of Djuna Barnes and the subtle comedy of Robert Walser, this semi-deranged erotic fairy tale introduces American readers to the marvelous Anne Serre. <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>The author of fourteen novels and short story books, <strong>Anne Serre</strong> was born in 1960. Her first novel, <em>Les Gouvernantes</em>, was published in 1992, and praised by Michel Cr�pu in La Croix for its &#x201c;remarkable economy of style.&#x201d;</p><p>Mark Hutchinson was born in London in 1957 and lives in Paris. Among his many translations are Ren� Char&#x2019;s <em>Hypnos: Notes from the French Resistance</em> and <em>The Inventors and Other Poems</em>.</p>&#x201c;Told in surrealist bursts, this novella combines the dreaminess of Barbara Comyns, Aimee Bender, and Kathryn Davis with the fairy-tale eroticism of Angela Carter. Each sentence evokes a dream logic both languid and circuitous as the governesses move through a fever of domesticity and sexual abandon. A sensualist, surrealist romp.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A cruel and exhilarating book. Anne Serre&#x2019;s style is perfectly controlled. Colorful, by turns elegant and violent, it provokes that enchantment borne out of an unbridled imagination.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paula Jacques, <em>Marie-Claire</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A hypnotic tale of three governesses and the sensuous education they provide. Ines, Laura, and El�onore are not exactly Jane Eyre types. Prone to Dionysian frenzies, should any passerby fall &#x201c;into the trap of their vast, lunar privacy,&#x201d; they pounce upon, seduce, and devour him (&#x201c;in a ladylike manner&#x201d;) to sate their ungovernable desires. This could be the setup for a neo-pagan farce, but as Serre delves into the three women&#x2019;s existence, the novel taps into deeper, quieter waters: the Keatsian twinning of joy and melancholy. Serre&#x2019;s wistful ode to pleasure is as enchanting as its three nymph-like protagonists.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;"A feminist fantasy, where women satisfy their sexual needs free from society&#x2019;s opprobrium."&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sophie Lellman, <em>The Arts Fuse</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Every so often a different creature darts into view: a novel that is genuinely original &#x2015; and, often, very quietly so.

United by a classical text called "The Dream of Scipio," three men struggle to find refuge for their hearts and minds from the madness that surrounds them in the final days of the Roman Empire, in the grim years of the Black Death, and in the direst hours of World War II. An ALA <i>Booklist</i> Editors' Choice.<br><br>Iain Pears's <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i> and <i>The Portrait </i>are also available from Riverhead Books.</p><p>Like his elegant debut, <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i>, Iain Pears's <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> is an inventive, gloriously detailed historical novel told from multiple viewpoints. But Pears has set himself an additional challenge by spreading his narrators over several centuries: there's the fifth century French nobleman and bishop, Manlius, a civilized man who has embraced the uncouth Christian faith in order to protect what he holds dear; an 11th-century scholar and troubadour named Olivier de Noyen, the famously ill-fated admirer of a married girl; and Julien Barneuve, an early 20th-century scholar of de Noyen who discovers, through him, a magnificent manuscript of Manlius's called "The Dream of Scipio." Though all three men come from the same small Proven�al town, it is this manuscript, derived from the teachings of a wise woman, that links the three narrative threads of Pears's story. At the heart of <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> and, one suspects, at the heart of its author, is the conflict between a classical ideal of learning and the contemplation of beauty, and the noisy, uncivilized, democratizing impulses of the Christian era. A novel of ideas like its predecessor, <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> is neither chilly nor didactic and doesn't shy away from depicting the costs of its narrators' unpopular devotions. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"Iain Pears aims high in his novels. <b>The Dream of Scipio</b> (Knopf), his latest, encompasses three narratives set hundreds of years apart in the same tiny corner of Provence, all three variations on a theme -- what is a civilized man to do when the barbarians are at the gate? And Pears pulls it off in a virtuoso display of craftsmanship that brings the stories, at the same rapidly building pace, to their very different, but subtly linked, conclusions." -- <i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i> <br> <b><i><br></i></b>"A dazzling triptych of love and ideas&#x2026;. Pears's finest book yet, even more successful and riveting than its predecessor&#x2026;.. [I]mmensely readable, fast-moving, and full of wonderful juxtapositions&#x2026;. Take a chance on this odd book. Youll be very glad you did." -- <i>Boston Globe</i> <b><br></b> <br>"Pears' elaborate narrative triptych is dazzling for its structure, its complexity, and the richness of thought that gives it texture. But, finally, it is the passion of the love stories, undercutting bloodless philosophy while embracing the messiness of life, that lets the novel soar." -- <i>Booklist </i>(starred review) <br> <br>" <b>The Dream of Scipio</b> is complex, surprising and thought-provoking, a dream of a novel in more senses than one. " -- <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <br> <br>"English writer Iain Pears possesses that wildly rare quality displayed only by writers like A.S. Byatt in <b>Possession</b> or Umberto Eco in <b>The Name of the Rose</b>: the ability to be both extraordinarily erudite and thoroughly capable of writing a novel that the intellectually unwashed can enjoy&#x2026;. <b> </b>Pears makes you think and want to learn more. This is not escapist literature but educational in the very best sense of the word&#x2026;. Pears has the ability to create characters who are immediately recognizable&#x2026;. this novel is worth your time." -- <i>USA Today<br></i> <b><br></b>&#x201c;If the highest test of a work of imaginative literature is whether it can make you think and feel at the same time, this novel passes it&#x2026;If a better novel is published this year and carries off the Booker and other prizes, I shall be amazed.&#x201d; -- <i>The Scotsman<br></i> <br>&#x201c;It is difficult to know where to begin in praising the achievement of this rigorous but infinitely beguiling book. The novel of ideas has been moribund for quite some time, but Pears breathes rude life into the genre with an epic that echoes the achievements of Robert Graves and Andr� Gide. The balance between the key questions of existence and the passionate, life-affirming solidity that the author grants to his characters is impeccable, and all three protagonists are forcefully characterised&#x2026;But above all, this is a piece of storytelling that almost redefines the very notion of the art: luminescent entertainment by a master, even more impressive than <b>An Instance of the Fingerpost</b>, the book which first drew attention to Pears&#x2019; highly individual skills.&#x201d; -- Amazon.co.uk <br> <br>"Combining the visceral pleasures of a thriller with the more intellectual excitements of a novel of ideas ....beautifully constructed and, for such a cerebrally challenging book, remarkably easy to read." -- <i>The Telegraph</i> (London) <br> <br> <b>Praise for An Instance of the Fingerpost</b> <br>&#x201c;Every sentence in the book is as solid as a brick -- and as treacherous as quicksand&#x2026; Iain Pears has written an impressively original and audaciously imaginative intellectual thriller.&#x201d; -- <i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><h2>Life in Celtic Times Coloring Book (Dover World History Coloring Books)</h2><p>Feared in battle by their opponents, adept at farming and cattle raising, the Celts were a remarkable people whose height, muscularity, and fair complexion set them apart from their Roman contemporaries.

Author: Sogyal Rinpoche, author of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying<br><br>"Many years ago I heard a Dharma talk by Lama Yeshe. I was very impressed with his ability to communicate deep truths in very ordinary language, with a hilarious sense of humor that helped deliver such wisdom. But he died, so my attention eventually went elsewhere. Recently, I discovered his books--some very technical Tantra; some down-to-earth wisdom. Lama Yeshe's same gift was present in both modes. Although, my many years of Dharma training is in Theravadin Buddhism, especially the practice of vipassana meditation, I found his teaching once again to be of great value--so direct, so clear. Granted, some of his technical Tantra seemed to me, at first, of limited relevance to my interests. But upon closer reading, and in his hands, these teachings proved equally valuable. Lama Yeshe has given us a body of teaching of immense signifciance for practitioners of all schools of Buddhadharma."

Amidst extremes of celibacy versus marriage in Christian traditions on the one hand and today&#x2019;s proliferation of sexual noncommitment on the other, Danylak gives us a thorough-going biblical theology of singleness.

Scott Horrell</strong>, Professor of Theological Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Barry Danylak&#x2019;s book on singleness is now the most thorough and helpful book on the subject. He treats directly the main difficulty in grasping the new covenant view&#x2015;the strong Old Testament emphasis on procreation and its importance for establishing and carrying forward the old-covenant people. The change in the nature of the blessing of God for the human race that comes with the new covenant is the key new perspective for understanding Christian singleness, a perspective too often missed in discussions of singleness and voluntary celibacy in the Christian life.

From the New Testament he firmly grasps the nettle of exegetically difficult passages, and with reference to the cultural influences brings a redemptive perspective to singleness for the contemporary world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John D. Wilson</strong>, Missiologist and Mentor (Southeast Asia), World Team</p><p>&#x201c;In this long overdue review of the biblical stance on singleness, Danylak looks at the biblical attitudes with great care and manages to affirm both marriage and the gift of singleness.

The other half dozen pieces examine other Russian writers and philosophers, including Alexander Herzen, Ivan Turgenev, and Mikhail Bakunin--although the latter, Berlin says, "is not a serious thinker. There are no coherent ideas to be extracted from his writings of any period, only fire and imagination, violence and poetry, and an ungovernable desire for strong sensations." Few, if any, English-language critics have written as perceptibly about Russian thought and culture as the Latvian-born Berlin, and the history covered in <i>Russian Thinkers</i> is a unique elaboration of Berlin's theses concerning the impact of ideas upon culture.<b>Isaiah Berlin</b>, O.M., C.B.E., first President of Wolfson College, Oxford, from 1966 to 1975, is a Fellow of All Souls.

He delivered to Governor Dayton over 12,000 petitions from Minnesotans opposed to sulfide mining in the Lake Superior watershed and very close to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. His successful trip&#x2014;through challenging weather, trail and road conditions&#x2014;brought to the attention of many Minnesotans the real risks that both Lake Superior and the Boundary Waters face from the proposed copper/nickel sulfide mines. Getting his sled dog team to the Capitol was so much more than that epic eight-day trip. It was in fact the culminating adventure of a much longer journey for Frank and his incredible dog team. The book 'Sled Dogs to Saint Paul' is the story of Frank&#x2019;s discovery of dog sledding, and how the dogs came to be the focus of his life. Beginning with his first dogsled adventures on the lakes and trails near Bemidji, Minnesota, it continues to tell of Frank&#x2019;s rise in world of sled-dog racing and what led to the mission that now drives his kennel. The story is sometimes funny, and at other times quite serious yet always epic in some way. Excerpts from this manuscript were first published in Flyway, Journal of Writing and Environment, in the Winter of 2011/2012.</p><p>With their forty Alaskan Husky sled dogs, Frank Moe and his wife Sherri live near Grand Marais, Minnesota, on the North Shore of Lake Superior. When he&#x2019;s not training and racing, Frank and Sherri love to work in their garden, chop wood to heat their off-the-grid log cabin, or guide canoeing, sea-kayaking and rock-climbing trips on Lake Superior and in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

The series is drawn by yet another Doctor Who creator, Matthew Dow Smith, who has also illustrated the likes of Hellboy, Supernatural: Origins and Sandman Mystery Theatre.&#x201c;The book is enjoyable on two levels, for both the complete novice and for the knowledgeable fan.

It takes a conceptual approach by covering the wide range of scholarship being done on masculinities beyond the model of hegemonic masculinity. C.J. Pascoe and Tristan Bridges extend the boundaries of the field and provide a new framework for understanding masculinities studies. Rather than taking a topics-based approach to masculinity, <em>Exploring Masculinities</em> offers an innovative conceptual approach that enables students to study a given phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. It divides up the field in ways that provide accessible introductions to complex debates and key intra- and interdisciplinary distinctions.

The foul deed is committed during the contest&#x2019;s final round. Only five riddles separate the contestants from the million-dollar cash prize when someone finds the sweet smell of success too intoxicating to leave to chance. Now the contest creator is dead and the answers stolen from his wallet, and it&#x2019;s up to Wolfe to follow the trail of clues to a source disturbingly close to home.<br><br> <b>Introduction by Robert Crais</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery. The man has entered our folklore.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> A grand master of the form, Rex Stout is one of America&#x2019;s greatest mystery writers, and his literary creation Nero Wolfe is one of the greatest fictional detectives of all time. Together, Stout and Wolfe have entertained&#x2014;and puzzled&#x2014;millions of mystery fans around the world. Now, with his perambulatory man-about-town, Archie Goodwin, the arrogant, gourmandizing, sedentary sleuth is back in the original seventy-three cases of crime and detection written by the inimitable master himself, Rex Stout.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Not that our small talk that Tuesday evening in April had any important bearing on the matter, but it will do for an overture, and it will help to explain a couple of reactions Nero Wolfe had later. After a dinner that was featured by one of Fritz&#x2019;s best dishes, squabs with sausage and sauerkraut, in the dining room of the old brownstone house on West Thirty-fifth Street, I followed Wolfe across the hall to the office, and, as he got some magazines from the table near the big globe and went to his chair behind his desk, asked if there were any chores. That was insurance. I had notified him that I intended to take Thursday afternoon off for the opening of the baseball season at the Polo Grounds, and when Thursday came I didn&#x2019;t want any beefing about my letting things pile up.<br> &nbsp;<br> He said no, no chores, got all his vast bulk adjusted in the chair, the only chair on earth he approved of, and opened a magazine. He allotted around twenty minutes a week for looking at advertisements. I went to my desk, sat, and reached for the phone, then changed my mind, deciding a little more insurance wouldn&#x2019;t hurt. Swiveling and seeing that he was scowling at the open magazine, I got up and circled around near enough to see what he was focused on. It was a full-page ad, black and white, that I and many millions of my fellow citizens knew by heart&#x2014;though it didn&#x2019;t require much study, since there were only six words in it, not counting repetitions. At the center near the top was a distinguished-looking small bottle, labeled in fancy script Pour Amour, with the Amour beneath the Pour. <br> &nbsp;<br> Right below it were two more of the same, also centered, and below them three more, and then four more, and so on down the page. At the bottom seven bottles stretched clear across, making the base of a twenty-eight-bottle pyramid. In the space at the top left was the statement:<br> &nbsp;<br> Pour Amour<br> means<br> For Love<br> &nbsp;<br> and at top right it said:<br> &nbsp;<br> Pour Amour<br> is<br> for Love<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are two things about that ad,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe grunted and turned a page.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One thing,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;is the name itself. To sixty-four and seven-tenths per cent of the women seeing it, it will suggest &#x2018;paramour,&#x2019; and the percentage would be higher if more of them knew what a paramour is. I won&#x2019;t decry American womanhood. Some of my best friends are women. Very few of them want to be or have paramours, so you couldn&#x2019;t come right out and name a perfume that. Put it this way. They see the ad, and they think, So they have the nerve to suggest their snazzy old perfume will get me a paramour! I&#x2019;ll show &#x2019;em! What do they think I am? Half an ounce, ten bucks. The other thing&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One&#x2019;s enough,&#x201d; he growled.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir. The second thing, so many bottles. That&#x2019;s against the rules. The big idea in a perfume ad is to show only one bottle, to give the impression that it&#x2019;s a scarce article and you&#x2019;d better hurry up and get yours. Not Pour Amour. They say, Come on, we&#x2019;ve got plenty and it&#x2019;s a free country and every woman has a right to a paramour, and if you don&#x2019;t want one prove it. It&#x2019;s an entirely new approach, one hundred per cent American, and it seems to be paying off, it and the contest together.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I had expected to get the desired results by that time, but all he did was sit and turn pages. I took a breath.<br> &nbsp;<br> The contest, as you probably know since you look at ads some, is a pip. A million dollars in cash prizes. Each week for nearly five months they have furnished a description of a woman&#x2014;I might as well give you the exact specifications, since you&#x2019;ve been training my memory for years&#x2014;&#x2018;a woman recorded in non-fictional history in any of its forms, including biography, as having used cosmetics.&#x2019; Twenty of them in twenty weeks. This was the description of Number One:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Though Caesar fought to give me power<br> &#x201c;And I had Antony in my grasp,<br> My bosom, in the fatal hour,<br> Welcomed the fatal asp.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course that was pie. Cleopatra. Number Two was just as easy:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Married to one named Aragon,<br> I listened to Columbus&#x2019; tales,<br> And offered all my gems to pawn<br> To buy him ships and sails.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t remember ever reading that Queen Isabella used cosmetics, but since nobody ever bathed in the fifteenth century she must have. I could also give you Numbers Three, Four, and Five, but after that they began to get tough, and by Number Ten I wasn&#x2019;t even bothering to read them. God knows what they were like by the time they got to Twenty&#x2014;to give you an example, here&#x2019;s Number Seven or Eight, I forget which:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My eldest son became a peer<br> Although I couldn&#x2019;t write my name;<br> As Mr. Brown&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s fondest dear<br> I earned enduring fame.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I call that fudging. Considering how many Mr. Browns have had sons in the course of history, and how many of the sons&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pah.&#x201d; Wolfe turned a page. &#x201c;Nell Gwynn, the English actress.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I stared. &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ve heard of her. How come? One of her boy friends may have been named Brown or Brownson, but that wasn&#x2019;t what made her famous. It was some king.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Charles the Second.&#x201d; He was smug. &#x201c;He made his son by her a duke. His father, Charles the First, on a trip to Spain in his youth, had assumed the name of Mr. Brown. And of course Nell Gwynn was the mistress of Charles the Second.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I prefer paramour. Okay, so you&#x2019;ve read ten thousand books. What about this one&#x2014;I think it was Number Nine:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By the law himself had earlier made<br> I could not be his legal wife;<br> The law he properly obeyed<br> And loved me all my life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I flipped a hand. &#x201c;Name her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Archie.&#x201d; His head turned to me. &#x201c;You have somewhere to go?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, sir, not tonight. Lily Rowan has a table at the Flamingo Room and thought I might drop in for a dance, but I told her you might need me, and she knows how indispensable I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pfui.&#x201d; He started to glare and decided it wasn&#x2019;t worth the trouble. &#x201c;You intended to go, and undertook to shift the responsibility for your absence by pestering me into suggesting it. You have succeeded. I suggest that you go somewhere at once.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There were three or four things I could have said, but he sighed and went back to the magazine, so I skipped it. As I headed for the hall his voice told my back, &#x201c;You shaved and changed your clothes before dinner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s the trouble with working for and living with a really great detective.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Division Street: America</h2><p><p><i>Division Street</i>, Studs Terkel&#x2019;s first book of oral history, established his reputation as America&#x2019;s foremost oral historian and as &#x201c;one of those rare thinkers who is actually willing to go out and talk to the incredible people of this country&#x201d; (in the words of Tom Wolfe).</p><p>Viewing the inhabitants of a single city, Chicago, as a microcosm of the nation at large, <i>Division Street</i> chronicles the thoughts and feelings of some seventy people from widely varying backgrounds in terms of class, race, and personal history. From a mother and son who migrated from Appalachia to a Native American boilerman, from a streetwise ex&#x2013;gang leader to a liberal police officer, from the poorest African Americans to the richest socialites, these unique and often intimate first-person accounts form a multifaceted collage that defies any simple stereotype of America.</p><p>As Terkel himself put it: &#x201c;I was on the prowl for a cross&#x2013;section of urban thought, using no one method or technique. . . I guess I was seeking some balance in the wildlife of the city as Rachel Carson sought it in nature.

The compact hardcovers don&#x2019;t sensationalize, but they make the point that their subjects are very ruthless people indeed. Catherine the Great might be causally known as a cruel dictator with lots of lovers, but author Vincent shows how the Empress of Russia actually took on her position (well, after she had her husband murdered) with some good intentions. Smart, unafraid, and well read, Catherine wanted to use the ideas of the Enlightenment to uplift Russia and its citizens. While able to make some improvements, palace intrigue as well as Catherine&#x2019;s own personality brought out her iron will. Young readers will find the manipulation of Catherine&#x2019;s early days particularly interesting. One of the best things about this series is the care that has been taken with the design and format. From the eye-catching covers to the solid maps and historical engravings and illustrations (all made to look of a piece, even though they may be from different sources), the books have pick-me-up appeal. Even kids who don&#x2019;t think they like history may change their minds when confronted with these.

Stephen is widely traveled and has worked in nonprofit communications and organizational training as part of his ongoing belief in helping others. </p><p><b>Tim Zeltner</b>'s award-winning artwork is largely inspired by the landscape of the Delaware Valley, where he grew up. His illustrations feature a unique combination of layered paint, glazes, and stains on wood. His favorite holiday is Halloween, and he lives in Toronto with his wife, Jackie, and dog, Jessie.</p>PreS&#x2014;A little seed tries to scare everyone he meets but is unsuccessful because of his size. A leaf, a grub, and snowflakes all rebuff his "boos." The wind encourages him to wait, and the seed falls asleep for the winter. When he awakes in the spring, he's a sprout and he tries out another "boo," but to no avail. He keeps growing, however, until he becomes a pumpkin. Eventually he turns into a jack-o'-lantern and is easily able to scare everyone. This board book version of the title originally released in 2014 has a muted palette and soft, painterly illustrations with pleasing repetition, and a plot that will resonate with young readers and those looking for a slightly spooky tale.

His surprising finding is that the new technologies, expanding industries, and fast-growing countries that stockholders relentlessly seek in the market often lead to poor returns. In fact, growth itself can be an investment trap, luring investors into overpriced stocks and overly competitive industries. <br><br><i>The Future for Investors</i> shatters conventional wisdom and provides a framework for picking stocks that will be long-term winners. While technological innovation spurs economic growth, it has not been kind to investors. Instead, companies that have marketed tried-and-true products for decades in slow-growth or even declining industries have superior returns to firms that develop &#x201c;the bold and the new.&#x201d; Industry sectors many regard as dinosaurs&#x2014;railroads and oil companies, for example&#x2014;have actually beat the market.<br><br>Professor Siegel presents these strategies within the context of the coming shift in global economic power and the demographic age wave that will sweep the United States, Europe, and Japan. Contrary to the popular belief that these economic and demographic trends doom investors to poor returns, Professor Siegel explains the True New Economy and how to take advantage of the coming surge in invention, discovery, and economic growth. <br><br>The faster the world changes, the more important it is for investors to heed the lessons of the past and find the tried-and-true companies that can help you beat the market and prosper in the years ahead.</p><p>Jeremy J. Siegel is the Russell E. Palmer Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Siegel received his Ph.D. in economics from M.I.T. and is the author of the classic and influential <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i>. Professor Siegel writes and lectures about the economy and financial markets and has appeared on CNN, CNBC, NPR, and other networks. He is a regular columnist for <i>Kiplinger&#x2019;s</i> and has contributed op-eds and articles to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Barron&#x2019;s</i>, the <i>Financial Times</i>, and other national and international news media.Chapter One: The Growth Trap<br><br>The speculative public is incorrigible. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some &#x201c;action&#x201d; in progress. It will fall for any company identified with &#x201c;franchising,&#x201d; computers, electronics, science, technology, or what have you when the particular fashion is raging. Our readers, sensible investors all, are of course above such foolishness. &#x2014;Benjamin Graham, <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, 1973<br><br>The future for investors is bright. Our world today stands at the brink of the greatest burst of invention, discovery, and economic growth ever known. The pessimists, who proclaim that the retiring baby boomers will bankrupt Social Security, upend our private pension systems, and crash the financial markets, are wrong.<br><br>Fundamental demographic and economic forces are rapidly shifting the center of our global economy eastward. Soon the United States, Europe, and Japan will no longer hold center stage. By the middle of this century, the combined economies of China and India will be larger than the developed world&#x2019;s.<br><br>How should you position your portfolio to take advantage of the dramatic changes and opportunities that will appear in the world markets?<br><br>To succeed in this rapidly changing environment, investors must grasp a very important and counterintuitive aspect of growth that I call the the growth trap.<br><br>The growth trap seduces investors into overpaying for the very firms and industries that drive innovation and spearhead economic expansion. This relentless pursuit of growth&#x2014;through buying hot stocks, seeking exciting new technologies, or investing in the fastest-growing countries&#x2014;dooms investors to poor returns. In fact, history shows that many of the best-performing investments are instead found in shrinking industries and in slower-growing countries.<br><br>Ironically, the faster the world changes, the more important it is for investors to heed the lessons of the past. Investors who are alert to the growth trap and learn the principles of successful investing revealed in this book will prosper during the unprecedented changes that will transform the world economy.<br><br>The Fruits of Technology<br><br>No one can deny the importance of technology. Its development has been the single greatest force in world history. Early advances in agriculture, metallurgy, and transportation spurred the growth of population and the formation of great empires. Throughout history, those who possessed technological superiority, such as steel, warships, gunpowder, airpower, and most recently nuclear weapons, have won the decisive battles that allowed them to rule over vast parts of the earth&#x2014;or to stop others from doing so.<br><br>In time, the impact of technology spread far beyond the military sphere. Technology has allowed economies to produce more with less: more cloth with fewer weavers, more castings with fewer machines, and more food with less land. Technology was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution; it launched the world on a path of sustained productivity growth.<br><br>Today, the evidence of that growth is seen everywhere. In the developed world, only a small fraction of work is devoted to securing life&#x2019;s necessities. Advancing productivity has allowed us to achieve better health, retire earlier, live longer, and enjoy vastly more leisure time. Even in the poorer regions of our globe, advances in technology during the past century have reduced the percentage of the world&#x2019;s population faced with starvation and those living in extreme poverty.<br><br>Indeed, the invention of new technologies has enabled thousands of inventors and entrepreneurs&#x2014;from Thomas Edison to Bill Gates&#x2014;to become fabulously wealthy by forming public companies. The corporations that Edison and Gates founded&#x2014;General Electric and, a century later, Microsoft Corp.&#x2014;are now ranked number one and two in the world in market value, having a combined capitalization in excess of half a trillion dollars.<br><br>Because investors see the enormous wealth of innovators like Bill Gates, they assume they must seek out the new, innovative firms and avoid the older firms that will eventually be upended by advancing technologies. Many of the firms that pioneered automobiles, radio, television, and then the computer and cell phone have not only contributed to economic growth, but also became very profitable. As a result, we set our investment strategies toward acquiring these ground-breaking firms that vanquished the older technologies, naturally assuming our fortunes will increase as these firms profit.<br><br>The Growth Trap<br><br>But all the assumptions behind these investment strategies prove false. In fact, my research shows that exactly the opposite is true: not only do new firms and new industries fail to deliver good returns for investors, but their returns are often inferior to those of older companies established decades earlier.<br><br>Our fixation on growth is a snare, enticing us to place our assets in what we think will be the next big thing. But the most innovative companies are rarely the best place for investors. Technological innovation, which is blindly pursued by so many seeking to &#x201c;beat the market,&#x201d; turns out to be a double-edged sword that spurs economic growth while repeatedly disappointing investors.<br><br>Who Gains&#x2014;and Who Loses?<br><br>How can this happen? How can these enormous economic gains made possible through the proper application of new technology translate into substantial investment losses? There&#x2019;s one simple reason: in their enthusiasm to embrace the new, investors invariably pay too high a price for a piece of the action. The concept of growth is so avidly sought after that it lures investors into overpriced stocks in fast-changing and overly competitive industries, where the few big winners cannot begin to compensate for the myriad of losers.<br><br>I am not saying there are no gains to be reaped from the creative process. Indeed, there are many who become extremely wealthy from creating the new. If this were not so, there would be no motivation for entrepreneurs to develop pathbreaking technologies nor investors to finance them.<br><br>Yet the benefits of all this growth are funneled not to individual investors but instead to the innovators and founders, the venture capitalists who fund the projects, the investment bankers who sell the shares, and ultimately to the consumer, who buys better products at lower prices. The individual investor, seeking a share of the fabulous growth that powers the world economy, inevitably loses out.<br><br>History&#x2019;s Best Long-term Stocks<br><br>To illustrate the growth trap, imagine for a moment that we are investors capable of time travel, so we are in the remarkable position of being able to use hindsight to make our investment decisions. Let&#x2019;s go back to 1950 and take a look at two companies with an eye toward buying the stock of one and holding it to the present day. Let&#x2019;s choose between an old-economy company, Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil), and a new- economy juggernaut, IBM.<br><br>After making your selection and buying the stock, you instruct the firm to reinvest all cash dividends back into its shares, and you put your investment under lock and key. This is an investment that will be opened a half century later, the shares to be sold to fund your grandchild&#x2019;s education, your favorite charity, or even your own retirement, if you make this choice when you are young.<br><br>Which firm should you buy? And why?<br><br>The Economy at MidCentury<br><br>The first question you might have asked back in 1950 is: which sector of the economy will grow the fastest over the second half of the twentieth century, technology or energy? Fortunately, a quick review of history readily provides the answer. Technology firms were poised for rapid growth.<br><br>Not unlike today, the world in 1950 stood at the edge of tremendous change. U.S. manufacturers had shifted from munitions to consumer products, with technology leading the way. In 1948 there were 148,000 television sets in American homes. By 1950 that number had risen to 4.4 million; two years later, the figure was 50 million. The speed of penetration of this new medium was phenomenal and far exceeded that of the personal computer in the 1980s or the Internet in the 1990s.<br><br>Innovation was transforming our society, and 1950 was a hallmark year of invention. Papermate developed the first mass-produced, leak-proof ballpoint pen, and Haloid (later renamed Xerox) developed the first copy machine. The financial industry, already a heavy user of technology, was about to take a great leap forward as Diner&#x2019;s Club introduced the first credit card in 1950. And Bell Telephone Laboratories, a branch of the largest corporation on earth, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, had just perfected the transistor, a critical milestone that led to the computer revolution.<br><br>The future looked so bright that the term &#x201c;new economy,&#x201d; so often bandied about during the 1990s technology boom, was also used describe the economy fifty years earlier. Fortune magazine celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary in 1955 with a special series devoted to &#x201c;The New Economy&#x201d; and the remarkable growth of productivity and income that America had achieved since the Great Depression.<br><br>IBM or Standard Oil of New Jersey?<br><br>Let me give you some other information to help you make your decision. Look at Table 1.1, which compares the vital growth statistics of these two firms. IBM beat Jersey Standard by wide margins in every growth measure that Wall Street uses to pick stocks: sales, earnings, dividends, and sector growth. IBM&#x2019;s earnings per share, Wall Street&#x2019;s favorite stock-picking criterion, grew more than four percentage points per year above the oil giant&#x2019;s growth over the next fifty years. As information technology advanced and computers became far more important to our economy, the technology sector rose from 3 percent of the market to almost 18 percent.<br><br><i>table 1.1: annual growth rates, 1950&#x2013;2003<br>Growth MeasuresIBMStandard Oil of NJAdvantage<br>Revenue Per Share12.19%8.04%IBM<br>Dividends Per Share9.19%7.11%IBM<br>Earnings Per Share10.94%7.47%IBM<br>Sector Growth*14.65%-14.22%IBM<br>*Change in market share of technology and energy sectors 1957&#x2013;2003</i><br><br>In contrast, the oil industry&#x2019;s share of the market shrunk dramatically over this period. Oil stocks comprised about 20 percent of the market value of all US stocks in 1950, but fell to less than 5 percent by year 2000. This shrinkage occurred despite the fact that nuclear power never attained the dominance expected by its advocates and the world continued to be powered by fossil fuels.<br><br>If a genie would have whispered these facts in your ear in 1950, would you have placed your money in IBM or Standard Oil of New Jersey?<br><br>If you answered IBM, you have fallen victim to the growth trap.<br><br>Although both stocks did well, investors in Jersey Standard earned 14.42 percent per year on their shares from 1950 through 2003, more than half a percentage point ahead of IBM&#x2019;s 13.83 percent annual return. Although this difference is small, when you opened your lockbox fifty-three years later, the $1,000 you invested in the oil giant would be worth over $1,260,000 today, while $1,000 invested in IBM would be worth less than one million dollars, some 25 percent less.</p><h2>Get Out Now: Why You Should Pull Your Child from Public School Before It&#39;s Too Late</h2><p>Should we stay or should we go? Millions of parents with children in public schools can't believe they're asking this question. But they are. And you should be asking it too. Almost overnight, America's public schools have become morally toxic. And they are especially poisonous for the hearts and minds of children from religious families of every faith&#x2014;ordinary families who value traditional morality and plain old common sense. Parents' first duty is to their children&#x2014;to their intellect, their character, their souls.

The culture<br> war is over in most public schools&#x2014;and our side lost. Mary Rice Hasson&#x2019;s and Theresa Farnan&#x2019;s<br> galvanizing case for a public school exodus should be a game-changer for conservative parents,<br> especially religious believers under the outdated illusion that their kids can be &#x2018;salt and light&#x2019; in<br> such hostile deserts.&#x201d;<br> <b>Rod Dreher</b>, author of <i>The Benedict Option</i><br> <br>&#x201c;I share the authors&#x2019; view that there are dedicated and talented teachers and<br> administrators&#x2014;many of them former students of mine&#x2014;serving heroically in our public<br> schools. But as Farnan and Hasson show, parents send their children to public schools at great<br> peril. The risk to mind, body, and soul is too high.

After years of focusing on the needs of others as a wife and mother, Anderson devoted a year to rediscovering herself and reinvigorating her dreams. The questions she asked herself and the insights she gained became the core of the popular weekend workshops Anderson developed to help women figure out how&#x2014;after being all things to all people&#x2014;they can finally become what they need to be for themselves. <i>A Weekend to Change Your Life </i>brings Anderson&#x2019;s techniques to women everywhere, providing a step-by-step path readers can follow at their own pace.<br><br>Drawing on her own life and on the experiences of the women she meets at her workshops, Anderson shows women how to move beyond the roles they play in relationship to others and reclaim their individuality. Through illustrations and gentle instruction, she illuminates the rewards of nurturing long-neglected talents, revitalizing plans sacrificed to the demands of family life, and redefining oneself by embracing new possibilities.<br><br><b>Wake Up, Sister.

We have spent the greater part of our lives pouring ourselves out like pitchers. No wonder we feel so empty. But we lack the necessary energy, a helpful roadmap, and any type of guidance and support. Well, it's time to change all of that.<br><br>The first step is to recognize that you are lost. In Ingmar Bergman's film <i>Face to Face</i>, Jenny, an accomplished yet empty woman, says: "We [women] act the part. We learn the lines. We know what people want us to say. In the end, it's not even deliberate, because we are so very conscientious about our behavior." It may seem almost impossible to get back behind the habit of performance to that raw-material person we once were. But it's not.<br><br>I was a suburban mother of two sons, a supportive wife to a busy man, a devoted daughter and daughter-in-law to four aging parents, and a reliable nurturer to multiple members of our extended family and friends. Chained to my agenda and telephone, I prided myself on being a multi-tasking wonder, fixing, along the way, my share of scraped knees, hurt feelings, and even some of my friends' failing marriages. Just call on me and I would happily run the school bazaar, handle the pledge drive for church, slice the oranges and pour the Gatorade for soccer and basketball games, all the while writing features for a local newspaper in order to earn some petty cash for extras. My calendar was so full that I took to taping extra paper onto the margins.<br><br>I would jump out of bed in the morning, throw on some clothes, make breakfast, pack the lunches, wave goodbye to everyone, clean up the kitchen, go for my walk, run errands, tackle my work assignments, return to the kitchen to prepare dinner and then do another round of cleanup, kiss everyone good night, and finally fall back into bed. For the most part, I performed so well that no one else even bothered to pitch in. If people did, I usually pushed their help away, confident that I had everything under control.<br><br>I was frenzied, but I felt important and full of my accomplishments. After all, didn't I produce the most beautiful dinner parties, holidays, and special family events? I was helping others, and both their progress and their smiles seemed like reward enough for me. My self-worth came from being the resident caretaker. It was as if I had been bred for the role.<br><br>In hindsight, I see that the training began back in puberty, when my body took on a life of its own. Once the hormones began to pop, the next forty years mapped themselves out for me. I was no stronger than my urge to mate, procreate, caretake--swept along all the way by the rush of giddy excitement, desire, and role-playing.<br><br>But eventually there was a downside to being this invisible sustainer, a hovering sense that I wasn't really as fulfilled as I thought. A pang of doubt would often sneak up on me unawares, when, for instance, my mother would help me serve dinner and repeat her age-old mantra: "Mothers always eat the chicken wings." It was a joke that went back to the Depression era, when a clever housewife was able to feed a family of six on one tiny roasted chicken. Yet, every time I heard my mother talk about taking the least desirable part of the bird, I felt sorry for her. After all, weren't mothers important? Didn't they need nutrition just as much as anyone else?<br><br>The doubting thoughts and questions became more frequent when our sons went to college. Blank spaces began to appear on the calendar, and I suddenly had too much time to spare. What should I do now? Distressingly, I hadn't the faintest idea. Enthralled with nurturing others, I had all but forgotten that I, too, had needs, desires, and goals. So I huddled with my girlfriends as we sipped too much wine and complained about our plight. We were all waking up to the stark reality that none of us had bothered to invest in our individual futures. What's more, my friend Cheryl concluded, "You don't get a gold watch for menopause!"<br><br>Searching for ways to assuage our ache, we began renting films about women at the crossroads, just to see how each protagonist found her way out of the quagmire. Ellen Burstyn ran away in <i>Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</i>, as did Shirley Valentine in the movie of the same name. Jill Clayburgh escaped into a series of affairs in <i>An Unmarried Woman</i>, and poor Gena Rowlands simply went crazy in <i>A Woman Under the Influence</i>.<br><br>None of these stories really offered us a strong solution, so we each went our separate ways. Virginia applied to law school; Adelia got her real-estate license; Judy, a recent widow, took a lover, and together they started traveling the world; Helen "came out"; Julie embraced the joys of grandmothering; and Cheryl ran off to her favorite island in Maine with her husband. I applauded my friends' actions, but their particular choices seemed to me to be more about finding something to do or a new relationship that would serve to distract them from their ache. I was craving something else; I just couldn't seem to put my finger on it.<br><br>I suppose I was hoping for a sign or event--some kind of ritual to occur that would free me up for a new course and identity. There were rituals to be sure: my sons graduated from college and moved into their own homes; one got married; another engaged; my father died; my husband turned fifty. But all of these transitions revolved around others. Although I was intimately involved in and changed by these events, none of them put the focus on me. Once again I was producing special-occasion moments and then feeling let down after the intensity of the event dissolved.<br><br>Then, one Christmas, during a visit to the married children, I truly began to understand that I had to stop looking for help from others; any change in my life was mine to initiate. From the moment Robin and I arrived, I felt very much out of place. The children had a clear vision for the holiday, and though they had included touches from both of their families, most of the plans were unfamiliar to me. What was worse, all of my offers to help seemed to fall on deaf ears. I repeated to myself that children have to reject us in order to get on with their lives. But I wasn't prepared to handle the power shift, or my brand-new role as bit player. So I took to retreating to the bedroom to hide my awkwardness. I had learned long ago that the Chinese character for "conflict" is two women under the same roof, and regardless of my own discomfort, I was determined to have none of that.<br><br>If truth be told, I wanted my old role back. I wanted to continue to design and control the traditions--to make my grandmother's coffee cake, open our stockings, and then have brunch before presents, complete with eggs Benedict. But I had realized long ago that staying in the "I want" place was ego-driven--I want to still be important to my sons, I want holidays to be my way, I want traditions to stay as I have always dictated them. I needed to let go of my wants and start concentrating on "I am" in order to find a new life and the bliss I sought. It was time to take charge of becoming a new me, and the first step was to admit that I was lost.<br><br>Soon after Christmas, something strange happened that forced me to listen to my invitation further. I developed a sensation in my throat that gradually made it almost impossible to swallow. Esophageal cancer, I thought, or, at the very least, a bad case of acid reflux! I raced off to my internist in a panic. After several tests, she concluded that the presenting symptoms amounted to nothing. Rather than a prescription, she handed me a book she had just read, <i>You Can Heal Your Life</i>, by Louise Hay. In this little book, Hay explains how negative emotions and high anxiety frequently produce pain--the body's way of telling us to change our patterns and live differently. In my case, I had to admit that I simply couldn't swallow the way I was living anymore. So, despite my fears, the lonely work of finding a new self commenced.<br><br>The psychiatrist I had started seeing applauded my realizations. "Good for you for wanting to be your own heroine," she said. "It's difficult, isolating work. You've got to break with the patterns of your past--not an easily achievable endeavor for a compassionate woman such as yourself, but well worth the effort." Although she continued to raise my consciousness, she didn't tell me how to break from these stultifying patterns, how to appease my inner gnawing, or how to become my own heroine. I remained puzzled, at a loss as to how to proceed, and I continued to struggle with feelings of apathy, tedium, and stagnation.<br><br>A Leap of Faith<br><br>That's when fate intervened. My husband announced that he had found an exciting new job in a neighboring state and that we would be moving in two months. <i>We</i>, I found myself thinking--what gives with the assumed <i>we</i>? As I listened in disbelief, I found myself countering with a plan of my own--I would view his opportunity as a chance to do something for myself and take a short refuge in our Cape Cod cottage. The words were out of my mouth before they were formed, and I shocked us both. Previously after being loose-tongued, I would backslide and apologize for my desires and opinions. This time I didn't. Instinct told me to hold to the course.<br><br>But taking a leap is one thing--landing on your feet is quite another. It was an impulsive decision, to be sure, and I hadn't the faintest idea what I was in for until I arrived at the cottage, with no one there to greet me and no agenda for distraction.<br><br>Unlocking the door and walking into a place darkened by shades was anticlimactic in light of the commotion that had surrounded the announcement of my great escape. I quickly whipped the covers off the fading furniture and threw open the windows to clear the air of must. But nothing I did made me feel any less uncomfortable in this familiar place. So I hurriedly left my empty nest and raced off to the sea. Walking on the beach has always cured my jitters, and I eagerly anticipated the exhilaration of frothy waves and wild surf. Instead, I found a glassy sea with no visible energy or motion. On closer inspection, I noticed the familiar circle that indicates that it must be ebb tide--the time when the sea is neither coming in or going out, simply turning itself around. Perhaps, I concluded, the ebbing sea was meant as a sign for me to indulge in a sort of psychic slumber--that I, too, was to ebb--that being in neutral for a while might help soothe my aching soul.<br><br>For the next several days, I packed my duffel and went to the beach, plotting my arrival in time for the ebb. As I squatted in the dunes, gathering my knees up close to my chest and rocking to the rhythm of the water, I tried to look backward to discern a vision I must have had for my life before it ran amuck.<br><br>Although I could remember numerous events from long ago, the recent year was a total blur. It took hours to recall even the smallest detail, let alone the big moments. But, sticking with the exercise, I was finally able to recall my birthday, a trip out west, getting a writing assignment from a magazine, and being bedridden with a bad back. Once I had the year in focus, I spent a rainy day reflecting on each event: was it fun, exciting, difficult, unfortunate, sad, depressing? For the most part, my memory remained sketchy, and many of the experiences, in retrospect, just seemed downright exhausting.<br><br>I decided to put squares around all the exhausting moments, triangles around those that were exhilarating, hearts around any moments shared with my husband, and, finally, circles around those activities that had been just for me. When I looked at the whole picture, I was more than startled. The page was, for the most part, all squares! What had started out as a little exercise turned into a major eye-opener. Surely I was living more for others than for myself, and I had given a lot more pleasure than I had received. I was exhausted, and what's more, it was my own fault. I had become an unwitting victim of my own obsessive planning, facilitating, and organizing!<br><br>The saddest example of all was our son's wedding. Because the bride's family lived so far away, I was left to organize the wedding on a tight budget. Although I thought I was having fun, I got so caught up in the minutiae of making sure it was perfect (of course) that I simply didn't remember a thing. Days later, I frantically ran off to have the film developed so I could see, and, I hoped, recall, all the pageantry and splendor that I had missed.<br><br>Give Your Life the Focus It Deserves<br><br>I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that it takes time and stillness to ask yourself during and after both major and minor events how you actually felt about them. "How did I feel about the surprise party I gave my husband?" Now, I don't mean: "How did the cake turn out? Did the guests have a good time? Did he like his presents? Was it better than the party he had thrown for me?" I mean: "How did I feel? Did I enjoy doing it? Was the work exhausting or exhilarating? If I had it to do over again, would I even have had the party? What did I want for myself going into this party, and did I get it?" These are not questions we ask ourselves when we are busy sustaining others and playing the roles.</p><h2>Baby Bod: Turn Flab to Fab in 12 Weeks Flat!</h2><p>A GROUNDBREAKING SELF-CARE PROGRAM FOR PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN, no matter how long it has been since you had your baby.

Wells, when he was 62 years old.The book is in his own words a &#34;scheme to thrust forward and establish a human control over the destinies of life and liberate it from its present dangers, uncertainties and miseries.&#34; It propounds that as the result of scientific progress, a common vision of a world &#34;politically, socially and economically unified&#34; is developing among educated and the elites, and this notion can be the starting point for &#34;a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity&#34; resulting in the development of a &#34;world commonweal&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>Melodious Masterpieces, Bk 1</h2><p>These masterpieces will encourage the performer to play in an expressive and reflective manner.

The master of Gothic suspense, H.P. Lovecraft, wrote about a mystical and dreaded grimoire, known as the Necronomicon&#x2013;&#x2013;an ancient text written by an Arab that, if it were to fall into the wrong hands, could have disastrous consequences. But no one thought the Necronomicon had any basis in the world outside of Lovecraft's fiction. Until...</p><p> Simon was a young man drawn to the mysterious world of the occult through his association with several Eastern Orthodox religions and his friendship with the owner of an occult bookstore in Brooklyn. In 1972 he stumbled upon a stolen text in a friend's apartment, unaware that what he held in his hands was the real Necronomicon&#x2013;&#x2013;something long thought to be a creation of Lovecraft's brilliant mind and deft pen. After an arduous translation, done in the utmost secrecy (since the tome was in fact stolen), Simon and his close circle of friends unveiled the now&#x2013;infamous grimoire to a clamoring public. </p><p> In Dead Names, Simon tells the amazing true story that surrounds the Necronomicon. From the main players' humble beginnings in the pageantry&#x2013;filled and secret world of Eastern Orthodox religion, to the accidental discovery of the Necronomicon, to the Son of Sam murders, the JFK assassination , the brilliant William S. Burroughs, and the eventual suspicious deaths of almost everyone involved with the grimoire, this book is an enthralling account of a book steeped in legend, lies, and murder.</p></p><p><p>Simon is a student of magic, occultism, and religion since the mid-1960s and the editor of the <em>Necronomicon</em>, Simon was a frequent lecturer for the famed Warlock Shop in Brooklyn and the Magickal Childe Bookstore in Manhattan for more than ten years before his sudden disappearance in 1984, speaking on topics as diverse as religion and politics, occultism and fascism, ceremonial magic, demonolatry, the Tarot, the Qabala, and Asian occult systems. He also conducted private classes for the New York City OTO during this period, with a focus on Enochian magic, "Owandering bishops," and Afro-Caribbean occult beliefs. An ordained priest of an Eastern Orthodox church, Simon has appeared on television and radio discussing such topics as exorcism, satanism, and Nazism. The media events he organized in the 1970s and 1980s -- with rock bands, ritual performances, and celebrity appearances -- helped to promote the "occult renaissance" in New York City. After decades of study in European, Asian, and Latin American cult centers, this book marks his first public appearance in more than twenty years.</p>Simon's 1977 "translation" of the <i>Necronomicon</i> exploited the name and legend of H.P. Lovecraft's invented book, but bore little resemblance to what Lovecraft's readers had come to expect. Now in this "history," memoir and answer to his critics, the author tries to have it both ways: his was not the Lovecraftian <i>Necronomicon</i>, but another work of blasphemous elder lore with the same title. Possibly Lovecraft had heard of it, Simon suggests. We are also asked to believe that the volume, like the Lovecraftian original, has a long and sinister history, including links to the Son of Sam murders, assorted suicides, the New York occult scene and even the World Trade Center attack. Lacking is any evidence that this is other than the work of the author's imagination. While the result may be of interest to students of the occult, it has little to offer to fantasy readers or Lovecraft fans. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book explains and shows in detail the various techniques used by fiddle players in creating a traditional style of playing. All the information is presented in the context of the music itself, with numerous transcribed and recorded examples. It is aimed not only at the beginner, but also the fiddle-player (and indeed violinist) with some knowledge and experience who wishes to learn more. For those unable to read music, a chapter on notation is included. Particular emphasis is given to bowing and ornamentation, with individual chapters devoted to jigs, slides, polkas, hornpipes, airs and reels. The book also attempts to convey something of the excitement felt in playing music which has a large degree of improvisation, albeit within certain bounds. The demonstration CD, which features a large selection of the transcribed tunes and ornaments performed by Cranitch, is an invaluable aid to learning as it allows the listener to hear how the music and ornamentation should sound.</p><p>Matt Cranitch, who lives in Cork, is renowned as a fiddle-player and teacher, both at home in Ireland and abroad. He has performed extensively at concerts and festivals, on radio and television, and has also presented lectures, master-classes and workshops on various aspects of Irish music, particularly fiddle-playing.

His daughter is found and brought up by a shepherd on the Bohemian coast, but through a series of extraordinary events, father and daughter, and eventually mother too, are reunited. <br><br> In <i>The Gap of Time</i>, Jeanette Winterson&#x2019;s cover version of <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i>, we move from London, a city reeling after the 2008 financial crisis, to a storm-ravaged American city called New Bohemia. Her story is one of childhood friendship, money, status, technology and the elliptical nature of time. Written with energy and wit, this is a story of the consuming power of jealousy on the one hand, and redemption and the enduring love of a lost child on the other.</p><p>Jeanette Winterson OBE has written ten novels, children&#x2019;s books, non-fiction works, and screenplays, and writes regularly for the <i>Guardian</i>. She was adopted by Pentecostal parents and raised in Manchester to be a missionary, which she wrote about in her first novel, <i>Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit,</i> and twenty-seven years later in her bestselling memoir, <i>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</i> <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i> tells the story of Perdita, the abandoned child. &#x201c;All of us have talismanic texts that we have carried around and that carry us around. I have worked with <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i> in many disguises for many years,&#x201d; Jeanette says of the play. The result is <i>The Gap of Time</i>, her cover version.<b>An NPR Best Book of the Year Selection</b><br><br>"<i>The Gap of Time</i> takes the play&#x2019;s themes of love, jealousy and estrangement and spins them into a taut contemporary tale."--<i><b>New York Times</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Hogarth leads off the series with one of the most gifted writers working today, Jeanette Winterson, taking on the formidable &#x2018;Winter&#x2019;s Tale,&#x2019; and the result is a shining delight of a novel...Winterson&#x2019;s gift for capturing unspoken emotion with powerful but never overwritten lyricism creates a cast of characters whose points of view are fascinating and sometimes harrowing to inhabit, fully employing the novel form&#x2019;s unique ability to illuminate the interiors of the actors on the page...The opening acts of the novel are propelled by an intricately suspenseful series of scenes that capture the raw violence stemming from greed, envy and paranoia. A subtle critique of hyper masculinity, and the attendant violence fueled by money (specifically the loss thereof), ripples meaningfully beneath the novel&#x2019;s surface. Winterson&#x2019;s great gift is capturing the emotional heft of her stories with sentences that hum along, beautiful, unexpected and swift...Winterson wrestles wonderfully with a perplexing text and emerges with a complicated, satisfying and contemporary tale that stands wholly on its own, despite the Bard&#x2019;s significant shadow. But then again, show me a novelist who isn&#x2019;t under that shadow. For that reason, and because Winterson makes the cover business book easy, I imagine many novelists are salivating for chance to write the next book in this promising new series.&#x201d;--<i><b>New York Times Book Review<br><br></b></i>"Winterson doesn&#x2019;t just update the story: she fills in its psychological nuances... It&#x2019;s fun to see Winterson solve the play&#x2019;s problems, but the book&#x2019;s real strength is the way her language shifts between earthy and poetic and her willingness to use whatever she needs to tell the story (angels, video games, carjackings). She makes us read on, our hearts in our mouths, to see how a twice-told story will turn out this time."--<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b><br><br>"[<i>The Gap of Time</i>]&nbsp;will keep you enthralled from start to finish."--<b><i>Paste Magazine</i></b><br><br>"The intricacy with which Winterson has plotted her novel against each Shakespearean detail will delight readers familiar with the original ... it&#x2019;s part of a vision of a world in which past, present, and future are lived simultaneously, original and adaptation existing in the same moment."--<b><i>The Times </i>(London)<br></b><br>"A book of considerable beauty... Winterson&#x2019;s fiction is a fine invitation into this deeply Shakespearean vision of imagination as the best kind of truth-telling."--<b><i>New Statesman</i><br></b><br>"Winterson&#x2019;s stage, like that of Shakespeare, is filled with wonders."--<i><b>Times Literary Supplement</b></i><br><br>"Winterson is faithful to both the narrative and the spirit of the play, while transposing it to an utterly different and modern setting... There is lightness here, in the frisky prose and the author&#x2019;s delight in invention, but you are never free of the awareness of dark shadows where danger and corruption lie in wait."--<i><b>Scotsman</b></i><br><br>"Artful...it soars."--<i><b>Financial Times</b></i><br><br>"A deeply felt, emotionally intelligent and serious novel, which resists easy answers and yet expresses the hope that human beings can muddle through, and that bad pasts can have good outcomes... Pulsates with such authenticity and imaginative generosity that I defy you not to engage with it."--<b><i>Evening Standard</i><br></b><br>"<i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale,&nbsp;</i>one of the late, 'problem' plays, is about loss, remorse and forgiveness, and the nature of time. Winterson has captured all this with respect and affection for Shakespeare&#x2019;s text, and made it new with her own bold and poetic prose and her insights into love and grief. There are passages here so concisely beautiful they give you goosebumps."--<b><i>Radar</i><br></b><br>"With a few deft strokes Winterson creates Shakespeare&#x2019;s characters in contemporary clothing keeping me in suspense throughout. It is a triumph and a good omen for this ambitious new project."--<b><i>Daily Express</i><br></b><br>"Emotionally wrought and profoundly intelligent it will pull you into its troubled, wise world of jealousy, paranoia, grief, revenge and forgiveness in some of the most stunning prose you&#x2019;ll read this year ... Winterson masterfully interweaves layers of narrative and themes so that reading the novel is like listening to a Bach prelude and fugue ... A supremely clever, compelling and emotionally affecting novel that deserves multiple readings to appreciate its many layers."--<i><b>Mail on Sunday<br></b></i><br>"The book is the first of a major new series, in which well-known novelists give Shakespeare a modern twist, and Winterson rises to the challenge with some ingenious touches."--<b><i>Observer</i><br></b><br>"Engrossing, almost soapily addictive novel."--<b><i>The&nbsp;Independent</i><br></b><br>"Astonishing."--<b><i>Elle</i><br></b><br>"There's a lovely, lilting cadence to Winterson's tribute to Shakespeare's penultimate play... Smart and witty... Despite her faithfulness to Shakespeare's storyline, Winterson manages against the odds to keep us gripped...she wins our sympathy and so injects a real sense of jeopardy into a familiar tale. It's no mean feat. Compelling, entertaining and elegant."--<i><b>The&nbsp;Guardian<br></b></i><br>"Moving, pacy... A clever book that explores themes of love, loss and forgiveness as parents screw up their children and do the unthinkable.

One man alone knew how to choose them. <br><br> Once the leaves had fallen and snow blanketed the ground, Julius Bl�thner made the trip from Leipzig by train and walked through the forest alone. Because of the elevation and the brutal cold, trees there grew very slowly. They stood straight and thick against the elements, their grain dense with rosin. Bl�thner nodded to the young trees as he passed, occasion�ally brushing their bark in greeting. He sought the older ones, whose branches he couldn&#x2019;t reach, whose diameters were so great he couldn&#x2019;t see if a bear were standing behind the trunk. He knocked them with his walking stick, and pressed his ear against them as his intuition dictated, listening for the music hidden inside. He heard it more clearly than any other piano maker, better even than Ignaz B�sendorfer and Carl Bechstein and Henry Steinway. When he found what he was listening for, he marked the tree with a scrap of red wool, which stood out bright against the snow.<br><br> Then the lumberjacks he&#x2019;d hired cut down the trees he&#x2019;d chosen. Watching closely, Bl�thner could tell which were the finest specimens by how they fell. Only those with a mini�mum of seven annular rings per centimeter, all evenly spaced, would be carried out of the forest on sleds, then shipped back to Germany. And the finest among these would become the soundboards that beat like hearts inside his famous pianos.<br><br> As protection against splitting, the logs were kept wet until they reached the sawmill. There they were quarter-sawn to unlock the purest tones, then sawn and planed into uniform planks. The wood chips went into the furnaces to heat the mill and power the steam engines. Because of knots and other imperfections revealed in the cutting, many of the precious tonewood planks also ended up in the furnaces. What was kept was nearly perfect: white in color; light and flexible; the faint traces of the rings densely spaced and running parallel across the faces of the soundboard planks. These raw boards were stored for at least two years, covered and uncovered until their humidity dwindled to about fourteen percent.<br><br> When it was ready, the wood was transported by horse cart to the enormous Bl�thner factory in the western quarter of Leipzig and laid out on racks near the ceiling in hot rooms for many months. But even then it wasn&#x2019;t ready to become an instrument. To ensure that the soundboard would someday conduct Bl�thner&#x2019;s peerless golden tone, the wood had to dry out for another few years in the open air.<br><br> It was with reverence, then, in 1905, that an assistant Kla�vierbaumeister selected a number of those carefully seasoned planks and glued them edge to edge to form a single board. He cut it to the proper shape and planed it to the proper thick�ness, flexible enough to vibrate but strong enough to push back against the pressure of more than two hundred strings. Once crafted, it was returned to those warmer rooms to dry further before thin ribs could be applied to its underside, per�pendicular to the grain lines. Then the soundboard took on a small amount of moisture, enough to allow its top to swell into a gentle curve, upon which the bass and treble bridges would sit, their downward pressure meeting the apex of the opposing curve as if around a great barrel. The Klavierbau�meister admired his work: the impeccably matched parallels of the grain, the precise curvature of the crown. This particular soundboard would provide the heart for the factory&#x2019;s 66,825th piano.<br><br> The frame of the case was built by other craftsmen, its five back posts sturdy enough to bear the weight of the sound�board and the iron plate. The pinblock was cut and fitted. The agraffes were seated into the plate at a height that would determine the speaking length of the strings, which were then strung; tuning pins were hammered in, and the action set and fitted. Cold-pressed felt was layered thick onto the wooden hammers, thinning appropriately toward the delicate treble side. Dampers were installed next, along with the trapwork of pedals and levers, dowels and springs. The case was ebonized after the guts were in, requiring countless coats. The finishers&#x2019; arm muscles bulged above their rolled-up shirtsleeves.<br><br> Next the instrument, nearly complete, was tuned, the ten�sion of each of the 220 strings adjusted to the correct pitch. Then it was regulated, the touch and responsiveness of the action attended to until the motion of the fingers on the keys would be properly transferred to the hammers that struck the strings.<br><br> At last, after many years of effort by many expert hands, the piano was delivered to its final station for voicing. The Meister there lifted the linen blanket covering it and passed a hand over the shiny black top. Why should this piano be special? Each one was special, with its own soul and distinct personal�ity. This one was substantial but unassuming, mysterious but sincere. He let the linen drop onto the factory floor.<br><br> &#x201c;What will you say to this world?&#x201d; he asked the instrument.<br><br> He shaped the hammers one by one, listening to every string, shaving and minutely aerating the felt again and again. He was like a diagnostician, knocking the nerves below a patient&#x2019;s kneecap, measuring the response. The piano called out each time in compliant reply. Hello, hello.<br><br> &#x201c;Fertig,&#x201d; he said when the work was done. He wiped the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve, pushed the wisps of white hair away from his face. Standing back from the piano, he regarded this complete and brand-new entity that would be&#x2014;after being played in properly&#x2014;capable of incredible feats. The first few years were unpredictable, but over time it would open up and gather into itself a unique history. For now it was a perfect instrument, characterized only by its potential.<br><br> The Meister fluffed his apron as he sat down on the barrel he&#x2019;d borrowed for a seat and, flexing his fingers, considered which piece to christen the piano with. Schubert, his favorite composer. He would play the rondo of his penultimate sonata, the big A Major; the opening melody was pretty, with a feeling of hopefulness and joy that preceded its more pensive, agi�tated development. This would be the perfect inauguration of the glistening black Bl�thner No. 66,825.<br><br> &#x201c;Listen!&#x201d; he called out, but nobody could hear him above the factory&#x2019;s ambient noise. &#x201c;Here she is born!&#x201d;<br><br> And he pressed his finger down on C-sharp, the first note of the rondo, listening hard, and it rang out to meet him with the innocence and power of a child&#x2019;s first cry. Finding it as pure as he&#x2019;d hoped, he began to play the rest of the sonata. He would send off this shining new piano with as much optimism as he could gather, knowing it would no longer be as vestal once it was touched by its future owners&#x2019; desperately human hands.<br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><br>Clara Lundy kicked a step stool against the front tire of an old 1996 Chevrolet Blazer and leaned over the engine, tossing her dark blond ponytail over her shoulder. She unscrewed the cap of the relief fitting and put a shop towel over it to catch the gas that leaked out when she pressed the valve. When the lines were bled, she stuffed the towel into her back pocket and went to her toolbox to grab the 16mm and 19mm wrenches and the quick-disconnect tool. Then, with an athletic jump, she disappeared into the yellow-framed pit so she could work from underneath. She removed the bracket, released the snap-lock fitting, and pulled the rubber hose off the outlet side of the filter first to keep the fuel from dripping in her eyes. She&#x2019;d learned that lesson long ago in her uncle&#x2019;s garage and had never forgotten it. <br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Clara?&#x201d; Peter Kappas, one of the shop owners&#x2019; three sons, peered down at her. A halo of late afternoon sunlight out�lined his bulky silhouette. &#x201c;That guy with the rack-and-pinion job&#x2019;s back again. He says it&#x2019;s still making noise.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Same noise or new?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Popping. Bolts, probably.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Can you do it? I&#x2019;m not done with this filter.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I promised the Corvette would be done by five.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara slipped the new filter into the bracket. &#x201c;Okay, give me fifteen. I&#x2019;ll get it up in the air and see what&#x2019;s going on. But if it&#x2019;s the mounting bolts, then you&#x2019;ll have to do the alignment again. You got time?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Stop.&#x201d;<br><br> He raised his arms. &#x201c;Kidding. Yeah, I can do it.&#x201d;<br><br> After she tightened all the bolts and checked the lines, she went back up to prime the system. She turned the key to On, waited for the fuel pump to kick on and off, then switched the key to Off. She did that a few more times, and sitting there, she glimpsed herself in the rearview mirror and was startled to see that she looked older than her twenty-six years, like she&#x2019;d aged a decade overnight. Her eyelids, in spite of the little bit of makeup she&#x2019;d put on, were still vaguely puffy from her cry�ing jag the night before. Her mouth was set so hard that tiny lines radiated from her lips; she&#x2019;d been clenching her teeth. When she relaxed her jaw, her pale cheeks seemed to sag and her mouth turned down at the corners. There was a smudge of grease across her forehead&#x2014;probably from having pushed her bangs out of her eyes&#x2014;that resembled her late father&#x2019;s birthmark. She looked at herself, at his light brown eyes and pale eyelashes, their matching high cheekbones, and felt a gut punch at this unanticipated image of his face in the mirror. An old grief added to the new.<br><br> She turned the key all the way, and the Blazer&#x2019;s engine fired up perfectly.<br><br> &#x201c;Clara! Phone for you!&#x201d; someone called above the noises in the shop: the hydraulic torque wrench and the air com�pressor, the glide and slam of toolkit drawers, the relentless clinking of metal, the ever-present <i>la�ko</i> music coming from a grease-covered boom box in the corner, the shouts in Greek and English.<br><br> She wiped the stain from her forehead with the dirty towel as she walked over to the phone that hung on the wall. Peter&#x2019;s brother Teddy stopped her with a hand on her forearm.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Ryan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You might want to take it in the office.&#x201d; Who knew what they&#x2019;d been saying about her and Ryan. Peter&#x2019;s mother, Anna, could read her face as though Clara were her own daughter and turn an opinion&#x2014;<i>I don&#x2019;t think this Ryan is good for you</i>&#x2014;into a topic for general discussion. Clara usu�ally found herself offering supporting information without even meaning to, and the entire Kappas family soon knew all her personal business. She didn&#x2019;t mind, though; they were the closest thing to a real family she&#x2019;d had in a long time.<br><br> Clara nodded. The office was little more than a desk against the wall in the waiting area, between the water cooler and the coffeemaker. It was hardly private, but there weren&#x2019;t any cus�tomers inside at the moment, and Anna, who was behind the counter writing an order for parts, winked at her and said, in her thick accent, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a minute.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara sat down and tried not to look at the flashing caller-on-hold light on the phone. She gazed instead at the framed photos on the wall of the Sporades Islands: the family&#x2019;s white�washed villa, the curved rock beach, the impossible turquoise water.<br><br> When she could avoid it no longer, she took a deep breath and picked up the line. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not answering your cell.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Whatever, Clara. Listen, I&#x2019;m taking off for a few days so you can pack up your stuff. I really want you to be out by the weekend, okay?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, what? Seriously? I thought we were still talking about everything.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Clara, did you not hear me last night? I&#x2019;m tired of waiting for you to make up your mind. You just don&#x2019;t want what I do.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I never said I didn&#x2019;t want the same thing, I just asked for time.&#x201d; She turned her body toward the wall. &#x201c;Ryan, please.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know you needed time, and I&#x2019;ve tried to give it to you. But I can&#x2019;t keep putting your needs ahead of mine. I&#x2019;m ready to move forward. I want a family. I&#x2019;d like it to be with you, but if it can&#x2019;t be . . . well, what choice do I have?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Look, I love you, Ryan, you know I do. But marriage is a big step. Why can&#x2019;t we just be together? Why&#x2019;s everything such a rush?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What is it about making this permanent that freaks you out so much? I know you love me. Why can&#x2019;t you just say yes?&#x201d;<br><br> Clara sighed. She could change this conversation, change her entire life, with just one word. But she couldn&#x2019;t do it. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;re done. I need you out. I need to move on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re really going to kick me out? After two years you&#x2019;re giving me, what, four days to move? How do you expect me to do that? And where am I supposed to get the money for it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know I wouldn&#x2019;t leave you on the street. I found you an apartment in East Bakersfield. I already put down the first and last months&#x2019; rent. I figured this would make things easier.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus, Ryan. Couldn&#x2019;t we have talked about it first? <i>East Bakersfield?</i>&#x201d;<br><br> He made a huffing sound. &#x201c;Do you really care where you live? It seems like all you really care about is that damn garage.&#x201d;<br><br> She balled the spiral phone cord into her fist, fighting the urge to cry again. Was she crying over losing him? Losing her home? Her own indecision?<br><br> &#x201c;The lease and key are on the kitchen table,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re out, you can drop your old key through the slot.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara rested her forehead against the wall and exhaled. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br><br> He paused, they both did, and she wondered if he&#x2019;d say what he always did at the end of a phone call. <i>You&#x2019;re my girl&#x2014;you know that, right?</i> She couldn&#x2019;t speak. She couldn&#x2019;t let go. She leaned forward in anticipation, waiting, yearning, yet reluctant to give in.<br><br> &#x201c;Good luck, Clara. I hope you figure out whatever it is you want, I really do. I&#x2019;m just sorry it wasn&#x2019;t me.&#x201d; Then he hung up.<br><br> She held the phone against her ear, listening to her heart�beat until the busy signal began beeping. When she turned around, Peter was standing at the door.<br><br> &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t answer right away. Maybe she hadn&#x2019;t really loved Ryan after all, certainly not how he wanted her to. But she was used to being with him, to having someone to go home to, and life with him had been easy. &#x201c;Will you help me move?&#x201d; she asked Peter.<br><br> He pulled off his ball cap&#x2014;<i>Havoline, Protect What Matters</i>&#x2014;and raked his fingers through his thick black hair. &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said, and put the cap back on. &#x201c;You know I will.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Neurotic Personality of Our Time</h2><p><p><strong>In this work, Karen Horney explores the basic structure of neuroses in the context of their cultural assumptions.</strong></p> Her topics range from the neurotic need for affection, to guilt feelings and the quest for power, prestige and possession.</p><p>Karen Horney (1885-1952) was one of the most influential psychoanalysts of the twentieth century.

But the Nobility moved on, and the castle sat empty, a place whispered of in ghost stories to caution young children to stay away. One day four of the village children vanished. Only three returned, with no memory of what happened or where they went... </li></ul></p><p>Grade 10 Up&#x2014;This is a manga adapation of the second volume in Kikuchi's multimedia series of the same name. One hundred centuries from now, following a devastating battle with vampires known as the Nobility, humankind has reverted to a near-medieval society. Outposts of humanity are still at risk from the supernatural and scientific legacy of the Nobility and the towns hire Hunters to protect themselves. Like a lone gunman of the Old West, Vampire Hunter D rides into one such town, vowing to clean it up, for a fee. This stoic, intelligent, and lethal Hunter teams up with a local girl who is destined for great things due to her high test scores. There is plenty of set-up and pay off in the story, while the dramatic and kinetic artwork carries the pair forward. This gothic, action-packed, and mysterious tale is sure to have lots of appeal, but its strong violence and sexual imagery make it best suited to the older teens.&#x2014;<i>Douglas P.

The election of 1800 was a thunderous clash of a campaign that climaxed in a deadlock in the Electoral College and led to a crisis in which the young republic teetered on the edge of collapse.<br><br><em>Adams vs. Jefferson</em> is the gripping account of a turning point in American history, a dramatic struggle between two parties with profoundly different visions of how the nation should be governed. The Federalists, led by Adams, were conservatives who favored a strong central government. The Republicans, led by Jefferson, were more egalitarian and believed that the Federalists had betrayed the Revolution of 1776 and were backsliding toward monarchy. The campaign itself was a barroom brawl every bit as ruthless as any modern contest, with mud-slinging, scare tactics, and backstabbing. The low point came when Alexander Hamilton printed a devastating attack on Adams, the head of his own party, in "fifty-four pages of unremitting vilification." The stalemate in the Electoral College dragged on through dozens of ballots. Tensions ran so high that the Republicans threatened civil war if the Federalists denied Jefferson the presidency. Finally a secret deal that changed a single vote gave Jefferson the White House. A devastated Adams left Washington before dawn on Inauguration Day, too embittered even to shake his rival's hand.<br><br>With magisterial command, Ferling brings to life both the outsize personalities and the hotly contested political questions at stake. He shows not just why this moment was a milestone in U.S. history, but how strongly the issues--and the passions--of 1800 resonate with our own time.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Ferling</strong> is Professor of History at the State University of West Georgia. A leading authority on American Revolutionary history, he has appeared in many documentaries and has written numerous books, including <em>John Adams: A Life, The First of Men: A Life of George Washington, Setting the World</em> <em>Ablaze: Washington, Adams, and Jefferson in the American Revolution</em>, and the award-winning <em>A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic</em>.<br><br>"Ferling at his best. It would be hard to find a better guide to the complexities of this very complex election, and Ferling is particularly good at showing just how many contingencies there were....Useful and lucid."--Herbert Sloan, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Ferling richly presents the twists and turns of the election, as well as a vivid portrait of a struggling new nation and the bruising political battles of our now revered founding fathers, including the major roles played by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton....Ferling's ultimate triumph is showing that, historically, when faced with dire circumstances at home and abroad, American democracy has pulled through."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"This is a stunning book, by far the finest ever on one of the most critical elections in the nation's history. If you thought 2000 was wild, wait until you read John Ferling's vivid and authoritative account of 1800. A brilliant historian and graceful stylist, Ferling topples old and new myths, and restores Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton to their proper places, while sustaining a lucid and gripping narrative. There is no better concise work on high political drama in the early republic--and on the tortuous and contested emergence of American democracy."--Sean Wilentz, Princeton University<p></p><br>"The tale of Adams and Jefferson is a painful and moving one. They were friends, then enemies, then friends again over a period of more than 50 years. Ferling does a good job of summing up the similarities that made their friendship possible as well as the differences destined to drive them apart."--<em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Ferling is especially adept at revealing the bare-knuckled partisanship that lay behind this vote, and the maneuvering between Burr and Federalists in the House of Representatives that might have made Burr president rather than Jefferson."--<em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"The 2004 campaign may seem tame after historian Ferling's riveting account of the 1800 presidential race."--<em>USA Today</em><p></p><br>"A well-written look at the enigmatic politics and personalities of the early Republic."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"A lively and reliable account of Thomas Jefferson's election as President in 1800, a fiery period in American history. Readers who assume that national politics in the 1990s was the dirtiest ever or that the election of 2000 was the most controversial will be struck to learn that political rivalries in the 1790s were even dirtier....General readers will find it exciting, clear, and instructive."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Ferling's straightforward narrative makes complicated history accessible to the average reader. He writes with authority, and his storyteller's touch makes many of these figures come alive."--<em>Wilmington News-Journal</em><p></p><br>"Guiding his reader through the critical time he calls the 'high voltage' 1790s, John Ferling makes sense of the crisis mentality that enveloped early America. From the 'narrow Squeak' that awarded John Adams the presidency in 1796 to 'something new under the sun' that spirited Thomas Jefferson into office four years later, Ferling lays out a tempting tale of political life, once again proving himself a careful, clear-headed interpreter of issues and personalities."--Andrew Burstein, University of Tulsa, author of <em>The Inner Jefferson</em> and <em>The Passions of Andrew Jackson</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Adams vs. Jefferson</em>, the distinguished historian John Ferling offers a fascinating narrative of the election of 1800 and demonstrates how that dramatic contest could have doomed the American experiment in republicanism. Instead, the election, a far more contentious event than the election of 2000, marked the true consolidation of the American Revolution and the triumph of the ideal of government resting on the consent of the governed."--John K.

The SUMMARY; and APPLICATION; sections are extremely insightful. With practical suggestions to make marital relationships more fulfilling, this book is for any man or woman who desires to understand the Scriptures&#39; healthy standards for courtship, marriage and sex.</p><p>Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum was Born September 26, 1943 in Russia, after his father was released from a Communist prison. Even though he is Jewish, his father was accused of being a Nazi spy when he fled Poland from Hitler. The Fruchtenbaums escaped from behind the Iron Curtain with help from the Israeli underground. They resided in Germany from 1946 to 1951, where Arnold received orthodox Jewish training. The Fruchtenbaums immigrated to Brooklyn in 1951, where they first came in contact with the American Board of Missions to the Jews (now Chosen People Ministries). At age 13, Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum became a believer in the Messiahship of Jesus. Arnold&#39;s father strongly opposed his beliefs, however; he allowed Arnold to continue associating with and learning from other Jewish believers until the family moved to Los Angeles in 1958. Once in Los Angeles, Arnold was forbidden to read the Bible, attend Christian meetings, or have anything to do with Messianic Jewish groups. Arnold, however; continued to maintain contact with Jewish believers and to walk with the Lord as best he could. Upon his graduation from High School, he was informed by his father that he would have to leave home because of his beliefs. In 1962, Arnold began undergraduate education at Shelton College. In 1966 He transferred to and graduated from Cedarville University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Hebrew and Greek. He moved to Israel that July, and studied archaeology, ancient history, historical geography, and Hebrew at the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and at the Hebrew University. In September 1967, Arnold enrolled at Dallas Theological Seminary. He also began working as a missionary with the American Board of Missions to the Jews. He graduated in 1971 with a Master of Theology degree. In June 1968, he married Mary Ann Morrow. In 1971, they moved to Israel, settling in Jerusalem. They worked with the local messianic congregation training young Israeli believers for service. His activities for Messiah drew the anger of the religious authorities in Jerusalem, finally forcing them to leave Israel in 1973. For the next two years he was a minister for the American Board of Missions to the Jews, and editor of The Chosen People. In 1976, he joined the staff of The Christian Jew Foundation as Associate Director of the largest Messianic Jewish broadcasting ministry in the world. In the summer of 1976, Arnold, along with others in Jewish missions, discussed the lack of discipleship and intensive biblical and theological training of Jewish believers. The early concepts of Ariel Ministries were born at that time. In December 1977 Ariel Ministries became a reality based on the principles of evangelism and discipleship. Arnold now serves as the director of the ministry. In 1989, Arnold completed his Ph.D. at New York University. He is the author of several books and has contributed articles in a number of books and journals. Frequently in demand as a conference speaker and teacher, he has traveled throughout Europe, Asia, Israel, and the United States, becoming intimately acquainted with the Messianic Jewish movement.</p><h2>Fresh India</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Meera Sodha is the author of Made In India, which was a top ten bestseller and was shortlisted for the 2014 Andre Simon Awards and the 2015 Guild of Food Writers Jeremy Round Award for Best First Cookbook.

But slowly and fitfully, corporations are changing. It&#x2019;s not just because of the high cost of making amends and a fear of negative publicity. Consumers are demanding better corporate behavior, and an increasing number of executives are eager to make their organizations more of a force for good.

Meanwhile, it also illuminates the history of Japan and its own struggles with racism and xenophobia, which led to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, ultimately tying the two countries together. <br> &nbsp;<br> Today, America is still filled with racial tension, and personal liberty in wartime is as relevant a topic as ever. Moving and impactful, National Book Award finalist Albert Marrin&#x2019;s sobering exploration of this monumental injustice shines as bright a light on current events as it does on the past.</p><p>Albert Marrin is the author of numerous nonfiction books for young readers, including the National Book Award finalist <i>Flesh and Blood So Cheap: The Triangle Fire and Its Legacy,</i> <i>A Volcano Beneath the Snow: John Brown&#x2019;s War Against Slavery,</i> <i>Thomas Paine: Crusader for Liberty,</i> <i>Black Gold: The Story of Oil in Our Lives, </i>and <i>FDR and the American Crisis.</i> His many honors include the Washington Children&#x2019;s Book Guild and <i>Washington Post</i> Nonfiction Award for an &#x201c;outstanding lifetime contribution that has enriched the field of children&#x2019;s literature,&#x201d; the James Madison Book Award for lifetime achievement, and the National Endowment for the Humanities Medal, awarded by President George W.

Roosevelt (December 8, 1941)<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On this bright Sunday morning, deck crews scurried about, hurrying to make final preparations. A huge flag bearing the red rays of the Rising Sun fluttered from the tall radio mast of each ship. These ships had graceful, poetic names: <i>Misty Island</i>, <i>Shimmering</i> <i>Mist</i>, <i>Haze</i>, <i>Daybreak</i> <i>Cloud</i>, and <i>Wind on the Beach</i>. Such names, however, belied the terrific firepower of the thirteen battleships, cruisers, and destroyers of the task force. At its heart were the six aircraft carriers they protected. The flagship, the 36,500-ton carrier <i>Red Castle</i>, steamed ahead, followed by the <i>Flying</i> <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Green Dragon</i>, <i>Increased Joy</i>, <i>Crane Flying in Heaven</i>, and <i>Lucky Crane</i>. Their objective was a shallow harbor on the western coast of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands, the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s chief Pacific Ocean base. Native people called it Wai Momi (Pearl Waters) for the pearl-bearing oysters that once were plentiful there&#x2014;Pearl Harbor.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The coming attack was part of a grand scheme to make Japan the ruler of Asia. To that end, the country&#x2019;s forces had invaded China four years earlier, in 1937. However, to succeed, Japan&#x2019;s military rulers decided they had to destroy the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. They knew their action would ignite global war&#x2014;a Second World War&#x2014; for the armies of German tyrant Adolf Hitler were already rampaging across Europe. What they could not know was that the conflict would be the greatest war of all time, claiming the lives of over seventy million, mostly civilians. This number, however, is far from the war&#x2019;s total cost, which can never be known. Because for each person killed, we must add countless others wounded and crippled, widowed and orphaned. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> At 6:00 a.m., the carriers turned into the wind to launch their planes from a position 270 miles north of Pearl Harbor. At a signal from the <i>Red Castle</i>, pilots raced their motors. As the planes sped forward, deckhands shouted &#x201c;<i>Banzai!</i>,&#x201d; meaning &#x201c;Long life!,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hurrah!,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Forward!&#x201d; Hours earlier, on the other side of the globe, in Washington, D.C., Operation Magic, a top-secret program for decoding Japanese radio signals, had told President Franklin D. Roosevelt that an attack was coming, but not where. So the War Department sent an alert to bases throughout the Pacific. Yet communication foul-ups prevented the message from reaching Pearl Harbor until <i>after</i> the attack.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a normal peacetime Sunday morning at Pearl Harbor. The navy ships were at anchor and tied up at their docks. No bugle calls woke their crews. Sunday was a day of rest, and captains ordered &#x201c;late hammocks,&#x201d; so the sailors could get up whenever they liked. That was good, since many nursed hangovers from Saturday night in Honolulu&#x2019;s saloons, dance halls, and &#x201c;social clubs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> At 7:55 a.m., early risers heard the drone of motors overhead. Moments later, 360 Japanese raiders&#x2014;fighters, dive-bombers, torpedo planes&#x2014;swooped down, each heading for its assigned target. Meeting little organized resistance, within a half hour they sank, ran aground, or severely damaged 18 warships. Three battleships became total wrecks, and 177 planes that had been parked on airfield runways were blown to bits, with a loss of only 29 Japanese planes and pilots. The enemy killed 2,403 Americans and injured 1,178 others. The next day, President Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Americans often idealize the &#x201c;good war.&#x201d; It surely was a just war, and, in that sense, good. The United States did not fire the first shots; it fought in self-defense, but also to rid the world of Asian and European tyrannies. Americans fought, said President Roosevelt, for every person&#x2019;s right to enjoy the Four Freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But as Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman famously said: &#x201c;War is all hell.&#x201d; A man I knew, a former infantryman, recently joined his long-gone friends from the Pacific campaigns. &#x201c;We were always at the spear-point,&#x201d; he would say, always risking their lives at the front. Glib talk of the &#x201c;good war&#x201d; infuriated him. Those who experienced it at the sharp end often called it the &#x201c;dirty war,&#x201d; a crusher of minds and bodies. &#x201c;Combat is torture,&#x201d; wrote one who knew, &#x201c;and it will reduce you, sooner or later, to a quivering wreck.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The war brought out the worst in people who in peacetime would never have dreamed of harming another live being. Marine corporal Eugene B. Sledge&#x2014;&#x201c;Sledgehammer&#x201d; to his friends&#x2014;described how combat in the Pacific changed him from a gentle eighteen-year-old who loved birds into a killer. &#x201c;To me the war was insanity,&#x201d; Sledge recalled bitterly. &#x201c;We had all become hardened. We were out there, human beings, the most highly developed form of life on earth, fighting each other like animals.&#x201d; It was a living nightmare. &#x201c;The war I knew was totally savage,&#x201d; Sledge continued. &#x201c;It was savage. We were savages.&#x201d; Some Japanese soldiers used the same words to describe what the war made of them. Nobody had a monopoly on virtue, and each side committed atrocities. Whether they did so to the same degree is still a matter of debate.</p><h2>Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy</h2><p><b>A powerful and original argument that traces the roots of our present crisis of authority to an unlikely source: the meritocracy.<br><br></b>Over the past decade, Americans watched in bafflement and rage as one institution after another &#x2013;&nbsp; from Wall Street to Congress, the Catholic Church to corporate America, even Major League Baseball &#x2013; imploded under the weight of corruption and incompetence. In the wake of the Fail Decade, Americans have historically low levels of trust in their institutions; the social contract between ordinary citizens and elites lies in tatters.<br><br>How did we get here? With <i>Twilight of the Elites</i>, Christopher Hayes offers a radically novel answer. Since the 1960s, as the meritocracy elevated a more diverse group of men and women into power, they learned to embrace the accelerating inequality that had placed them near the very top. Their ascension heightened social distance and spawned a new American elite--one more prone to failure and corruption than any that came before it.<br><br>Mixing deft political analysis, timely social commentary, and deep historical understanding, <i>Twilight of the Elites</i> describes how the society we have come to inhabit &#x2013; utterly forgiving at the top and relentlessly punitive at the bottom &#x2013; produces leaders who are out of touch with the people they have been trusted to govern. Hayes argues that the public's failure to trust the federal government, corporate America, and the media has led to a crisis of authority that threatens to engulf not just our politics but our day-to-day lives.<br><br>Upending well-worn ideological and partisan categories, Hayes entirely reorients our perspective on our times. <i>Twilight of the Elites</i> is the defining work of social criticism for the post-bailout age.</p><p><b>Christopher Hayes</b> is Editor at Large of&nbsp;<i>The Nation</i>&nbsp;and host of <i>All In w/ Chris Hayes</i>&nbsp;on&nbsp;MSNBC.

From 1999 to 2010, median household income in real dollars fell by 7 percent. More Americans are downwardly mobile than at any time in recent memory. In poll after poll, overwhelming majorities of Americans say the country is &#x201c;on the wrong track.&#x201d; And optimism that today&#x2019;s young people will have a better life than their parents is at the lowest level since pollsters started asking that question in the early 1980s.<br><br>It is possible that by the time this book is in your hands, these trends will have reversed themselves. But given the arc of the past decade and the institutional dysfunction that underlies our current extended crisis, even a welcome bout of economic growth won&#x2019;t undo the deep unease that now grips the nation.<br><br>The effects of our great disillusionment are typically measured within the cramped confines of the news cycle: how they impact the President&#x2019;s approval rating, which political party they benefit and which they hurt. Most of us come to see the nation&#x2019;s problems either as the result of the policies favored by those who occupy the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, or as an outgrowth of political dysfunction: of gridlock, &#x201c;bickering,&#x201d; and the increasing polarization among both the electorate and the representatives it elects.<br><br>But the core experience of the last decade isn&#x2019;t just political dysfunction. It&#x2019;s something much deeper and more existentially disruptive: the near total failure of each pillar institution of our society. The financial crisis and the grinding, prolonged economic immiseration it has precipitated are just the most recent instances of elite failure, the latest in an uninterrupted cascade of corruption and incompetence.<br><br>If that sounds excessively bleak, take a moment to consider America&#x2019;s trajectory over the first decade of the twenty-first century.<br><br>The Supreme Court--an institution that embodies an ideal of pure, dispassionate, elite cogitation--handed the presidency to the favored choice of a slim, five-person majority in a ruling whose legal logic was so tortured the court itself announced it could not be used as precedent. Then the American security apparatus, the largest in the world, failed to prevent nineteen men with knives and box cutters from pulling off the greatest mass murder in U.S. history. That single act inaugurated the longest period of war in the nation&#x2019;s history.<br><br>Just a few months later Enron and Arthur Andersen imploded, done in by a termitic infestation of deceit that gnawed through their very foundations. At the time, Enron was the largest corporate bankruptcy in the history of the nation, since eclipsed, of course, by the carnage of the financial crisis. What was once the hottest company in America was revealed to be an elaborate fraud, aided and abetted by one of the most trusted accounting firms in the entire world.<br><br>And just as Enron was beginning to be sold off for scraps in bankruptcy court, and President Bush&#x2019;s close personal connection to the company&#x2019;s CEO, Ken Lay, was making headlines, the Iraq disaster began.<br><br>Iraq would cost the lives of almost 4,500 Americans and 100,000-plus Iraqis, and $800 billion, burned like oil fires in the desert. The steady stream of grisly images out of the Middle East was only interrupted, in 2005, by the shocking spectacle of a major American city drowning while the nation watched, helpless.<br><br>As the decade of war dragged on, the housing bubble began to pop, ultimately bringing about the worst financial panic in eighty years. In the wake of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it seemed possible that the U.S. financial system as a whole would cease to operate: a financial blackout that would render paychecks, credit cards, and ATMs useless.<br><br>In those frenzied days, I watched Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury secretary Hank Paulson defend their three-page proposal for a Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in front of a packed and rowdy Senate hearing room. When pressed on the details by members of the Senate Banking Committee, Bernanke and Paulson were squirrelly. They couldn&#x2019;t seem to explain how and why they&#x2019;d arrived at the number they had (one Treasury staffer would tell a reporter it was plucked more or less at random because they needed &#x201c;a really big number&#x201d;).<br><br>Watching them, I couldn&#x2019;t shake a feeling in the pit of my stomach that either these men had no idea what they were talking about or they were intentionally obfuscating because they did not want their true purpose known. These were the guys in charge, the ones tasked with rescuing the entire global financial system, and nothing about their vague and contradictory answers to simple questions projected competence or good faith. I saw in an instant, with no small amount of fear, that the emperor truly had no clothes.<br><br>Washington managed to pass the bailout for the financial sector, and while Wall Street would soon return to glory, wealth, and profitability, the rest of us would, come to learn in gruesome detail all the ways in which the source of its prosperity had, in fact, been the largest Ponzi scheme in the history of human civilization.<br><br>The cumulative effect of these scandals and failures is an inescapable national mood of exhaustion, frustration, and betrayal. At the polls, we see it in the restless, serial discontent that defines the current political moment. The last three elections, beginning in 2006, have operated as sequential backlashes. In 2006 and 2008, Democrats were able to point to the horrifyingly inept response to Katrina, the bloody, costly quagmire in Iraq, and, finally, the teetering and collapsing economy. In 2010, Republicans could point to the worst unemployment rate in nearly thirty years--and long-term unemployment rates that rivaled those of the Great Depression--and present themselves as the solution.<br><br>Surveying the results of the 2010 midterms on election night, Tom Brokaw alluded to the collapse of trust in institutions in the wake of a war based on lies and a financial bubble that went bust. &#x201c;Almost nothing is going the way that most people have been told that it will. And every time they&#x2019;re told in Washington that they have it figured out, it turns out not to be true.&#x201d;<br><br>At a press conference the day after Democrats faced a &#x201c;shellacking&#x201d; in the 2010 midterm elections, Barack Obama recounted the story of meeting a voter who asked him if there was hope of returning to a &#x201c;healthy legislative process, so as I strap on the boots again tomorrow, I know that you guys got it under control? It&#x2019;s hard to have faith in that right now.&#x201d;<br><br>And who could blame him? From the American intelligence apparatus to financial regulators, government failures make up one of the most dispiriting throughlines of the crisis decade.<br><br>As citizens of the world&#x2019;s richest country, we expend little energy worrying about the millions of vital yet mundane functions our government undertakes. Roads are built, sewer systems maintained, mail delivered. We aren&#x2019;t preoccupied by the thought that skyscrapers will come crashing down because of unenforced building codes; we don&#x2019;t fret that our nuclear arsenal will fall into the wrong hands, or dread that the tax collector will hit us up for a bribe.<br><br>It is precisely because of our expectation of routine competence that government failure is so destabilizing.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve created this situation where we&#x2019;ve created so much mistrust in government,&#x201d; Ivor van Heerden told me one night in a seafood restaurant in the coastal town of Houma, Louisiana. For years van Heerden was deputy director of the LSU Hurricane Center, which issued a series of dire warnings about the insufficiencies of the levee system in the run-up to Katrina. After the storm, van Heerden was fired by LSU, because, he suspects, he was so outspoken in his criticism of the Army Corps of Engineers.<br><br>&#x201c;You have these politicians that are selling this mistrust,&#x201d; he said in reference to the ceaseless rhetoric from conservatives about government&#x2019;s inevitable incompetence. &#x201c;And the federal government sure as hell hasn&#x2019;t helped.&#x201d;<br><br>And yet the private sector has fared no better: from the popping of the tech bubble, to Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing, to the Big Three automakers, to Lehman Brothers, subprime, credit default swaps, and Bernie Madoff, the overwhelming story of the private sector in the last decade has been perverse incentives, blinkered groupthink, deception, fraud, opacity, and disaster. So comprehensive and destructive are these failures that even those ideologically disposed to view big business in the best light have had to confront them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always defended corporations,&#x201d; a Utah Tea Party organizer named Susan Southwick told me. &#x201c; &#x2018;Of course they wouldn&#x2019;t do anything they knew was harming people; you guys are crazy.&#x2019; But maybe I&#x2019;m the crazy one who didn&#x2019;t see it.&#x201d;<br><br>The dysfunction revealed by the crisis decade extends even past the government and the Fortune 500. The Catholic Church was exposed for its systematic policy of protecting serial child rapists and enabling them to victimize children. Penn State University was forced to fire its beloved football coach--and the university president--after it was revealed that much of the school&#x2019;s sports and administrative hierarchy had looked the other way while former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky allegedly raped and abused young boys on its own property. Even baseball, the national pastime, came to be viewed as little more than a corrupt racket, as each week brought a new revelation of a star who was taking performance-enhancing drugs while owners, players, and union leadership colluded in a cover-up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m 31, an Iraq war veteran, a Penn State graduate, a Catholic, a native of State College, acquaintance of Sandusky&#x2019;s, and a product of his Second Mile foundation,&#x201d; wrote Thomas Day, days after the Penn State scandal broke. &#x201c;And I have fully lost faith in the leadership of my parents&#x2019; generation.&#x201d;<br><br>The foundation of our shared life as Americans--where we worship, where we deposit our paychecks, the teams we root for, the people who do our business in Washington--seems to be cracking before our very eyes. In our idle panicked moments, we count down the seconds until it gives out.<br><br>In the course of writing this book, I spoke to hundreds of Americans from all over the country. From Detroit to New Orleans, Washington to Wall Street. I traveled to those places where institutional failure was most acute, and spoke with those lonely prophets who&#x2019;d seen the failures coming, those affected most directly by their fallout, and those with their hands on the wheel when things went disastrously off course. No one I talked to has escaped the fail decade with their previous faith intact. Sandy Rosenthal, a New Orleans housewife radicalized by the failure of the levees during Katrina founded Levees.org in order to hold the Army Corps of Engineers to account, and she described her own disillusionment in a way that&#x2019;s stuck with me: &#x201c;We saw how quickly the whole thing can fall apart. We saw how quickly the whole thing can literally crumble.&#x201d;<br><br>The sense of living on a razor&#x2019;s edge is, not surprisingly, most palpable in those areas of the country where economic loss is most acute. On a freezing cold January night in 2008, I accompanied the John Edwards campaign bus on a manic, thirty-six-hour tour of New Hampshire, and in the wee hours of the morning on primary day we stopped in the small former mill town of Berlin, New Hampshire. Murray Rogers, the president of the local steelworkers union and himself a laid-off millworker, was one of those who came out to greet the campaign bus as it rolled into the Berlin fire station at 2 a.m. When I asked him why he was there, he told me it was because he felt like no one in government cared about the fate of the millworkers of New Hampshire . . . with the exception of Edwards. When his mill had closed, he&#x2019;d written to all the Democratic primary candidates. Edwards, he said, &#x201c;offered to come and help us; he wrote a letter to the CEO because of the poor severance package they gave us. None of the others even offered to come.&#x201d; When news of Edwards&#x2019;s appalling personal behavior hit the papers, I immediately thought of Murray Rogers. Who would be Rogers&#x2019;s champion now?<br><br>In Detroit, the national capital of institutional collapse, the feeling of betrayal and alienation suffuses public life. &#x201c;Just drive around,&#x201d; a local activist named Abayomi Azikiwe told me in 2010. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just block after block after block of abandoned homes, abandoned commercial structures.&#x201d; Officially unemployment was about 28 percent, he said, but the real figure was closer to 50 percent. &#x201c;This is ground zero in terms of the economic crisis in this country. They say the stimulus package saved or created about two million jobs. We really don&#x2019;t see it.&#x201d; As hard hit as Detroit is, it&#x2019;s also probably the region of the country (with the exception of the tip of Lower Manhattan) that has most directly benefited from federal government intervention in wake of the crash. In many ways the bailout of the automakers was a stunning success, but like so many of the Obama administration&#x2019;s successes, it is one only understood counterfactually: things could be much worse. But if this is what success looks like, what hope do the rest of us have?<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember when I last heard someone genuinely optimistic about the future of this country,&#x201d; former poet laureate Charles Simic wrote in the spring of 2011. &#x201c;I know that when I get together with friends, we make a conscious effort to change the subject&#x201d; from the state of the country &#x201c;and talk about grandchildren, reminisce about the past and the movies we&#x2019;ve seen, though we can&#x2019;t manage it for very long. We end up disheartening and demoralizing each other and saying goodnight, embarrassed and annoyed with ourselves, as if being upset about what is being done to us is not a subject fit for polite society.&#x201d;<br><br>That emotional disquiet plays in different registers on the right and the left, but across the ideological divide you find a deep sense of alienation, anger, and betrayal directed at the elites who run the country. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an agent for angst,&#x201d; one Tea Party organizer told me, &#x201c;and the whole Tea Party movement is an agent for angst.&#x201d; The progressive blogger Heather Parton, who goes by the screen name Digby, has dubbed the denizens of the Beltway who arrogate to themselves the role of telling Americans what to think the &#x201c;Village,&#x201d; and it was Village mentality, a toxic combination of petty obsessions with status combined with access to power, that in her view produced the disaster in Iraq, and the financial crisis that followed. In Parton&#x2019;s telling, the Village is &#x201c;a permanent D.C. ruling class who has managed to convince themselves that they are simple, puritanical, bourgeois burghers and farmers, even though they are actually celebrity millionaires influencing the most powerful government on earth.&#x201d;</p><h2>Making Heirloom Toys</h2><p><p><strong>Professional designer and woodworker Jim Makowicki's 22-project collection reflects uncanny historical detail and technical accuracy</strong>.

In these papers Albrecht reveals the importance of the balance equation, that it isn&#39;t enough to have nutrient to soil connections, it is the ratio of one element to another that counts. Albrecht&#39;s insight further reveals that an ounce of prevention in the form of balanced plant nutrition from fertile soils is better than a pound of cure using dangerous poisons. Albrecht&#39;s work provides an indispensable foundation for anyone interested in sustainable, ecologically responsible agriculture.</p><p></p><h2>Waiting for Godot - Bilingual: A Bilingual Edition</h2><p>From an inauspicious beginning at the tiny Left Bank Th��tre de Babylone in 1953, followed by bewilderment among American and British audiences, <i>Waiting for Godot</i> has become one of the most important and enigmatic plays of the past fifty years and a cornerstone of twentieth-century drama. As Clive Barnes wrote, Time catches up with genius. . . . <i>Waiting for Godot</i> is one of the masterpieces of the century.&#x201d; Beckett wrote the play in French and then translated it into English himself. In doing so he chose to revise and eliminate various passages. With side-by-side text, the reader can experience the mastery of Beckett&#x2019;s language and explore its nuances. Upon being asked who Godot is, Samuel Beckett told director Alan Schneider, If I knew, I would have said so in the play.&#x201d; Although we may never know who we are waiting for, in this special edition we can rediscover one of the most poignant and humorous allegories of our time.</p><p>Samuel Beckett (1906-1989), one of the leading literary and dramatic figures of the twentieth century, was born in Foxrock, Ireland and attended Trinity University in Dublin. In 1928, he visited Paris for the first time and fell in with a number of avant-garde writers and artists, including James Joyce. In 1937, he settled in Paris permanently. Beckett wrote in both English and French, though his best-known works are mostly in the latter language. A prolific writer of novels, short stories, and poetry, he is remembered principally for his works for the theater, which belong to the tradition of the Theater of the Absurd and are characterized by their minimalist approach, stripping drama to its barest elements. In 1969, Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and commended for having &#39;transformed the destitution of man into his exaltation.&#39; Beckett died in Paris in 1989.<br><br> One of the true masterpieces of the century.&#x201d; Clive Barnes, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br> One of the most noble and moving plays of our generation, a threnody of hope deceived and deferred but never extinguished; a play suffused with tenderness for the whole human perplexity; with phrases that come like a sharp stab of beauty and pain.&#x201d;<br> <i>The Times</i> (London)<br><br> Beckett is an incomparable spellbinder. He writes with rhetoric and music that . . . make a poet green with envy.&#x201d; Stephen Spender<br><br> Reading Beckett for the first time is an experience like no other in modern literature.&#x201d;<br> Paul Auster<br><br> [Godot is ] among the most studied, monographed, celebrated and sent-up works of modern art, and perhaps as influential as any from the last century. The nonstory of two tramps at loose ends in a landscape barren of all but a single tree, amusing or distracting themselves from oppressive boredom while they wait for a mysterious figure who never arrives, the play became the ur-text for theatrical innovation and existential thought in the latter half of 20th century.&#x201d; Christopher Isherwood, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br></p><h2>Only Yours (Fool&#39;s Gold, Book 5)</h2><p><br><br>Montana Hendrix has found her calling&#x2014;working with therapy dogs.

Montana had been determined to get the nearly a year old dog into a therapy-dog training program. Sure, Fluffy was exuberant and clumsy, with a habit of eating anything and simply being too happy, but she had a huge heart. If she was, in simple terms, a screwup, Montana refused to hold that against her. Montana knew what it was like to fail to meet her potential, to always feel she wasn't good enough. She'd made a career out of it. Fluffy was not going to suffer the way she had. And even if she was projecting a little too much on to an innocent dog, well, sometimes that happened.<br><br>So there she was, on a beautiful Fool's Gold summer morning, walking Fluffy... or, rather, being walked by Fluffy.<br><br>"Think calm," Montana, holding firmly on to the leash, told the dog. "Therapy dogs are calm. Therapy dogs understand restraint."<br><br>Fluffy gave her a doggie grin, then nearly knocked over a trash can with a sweep of her ever-moving tail. <em>Restraint </em>wasn't in Fluffy's vocabulary. She was barely calm in her sleep.<br><br>Later Montana would tell herself she should have seen it coming. This particular morning was the first weekend after school had let out and there was a festival to celebrate. Street vendors had been setting up for days. Although it was early, the smell of hot dogs and barbecue filled the air. The sidewalks were crowded and Fluffy kept pulling toward the children playing in the park. Her expression was clear&#x2014;she wanted to be playing, too.<br><br>Up ahead, a mother paid for a hot dog. Her young son took it eagerly, but before he took a bite, he spotted Fluffy. The boy grinned at Fluffy and held out the food. At that exact moment, Montana was distracted by the latest display in Morgan's Bookstore and accidentally loosened her grip. Fluffy lunged, the leash slipped and that was when the trouble started.<br><br>Offering a hot dog from a distance might have seemed like a good idea...until a ninety-pound dog came barreling toward the little boy. He shrieked, dropped the hot dog and ran behind his mother. The poor woman had missed the beginning of the encounter. All she saw was a crazy-looking dog headed right for her and her son. She screamed.<br><br>Montana started after Fluffy, yelling for her to stop. But it was as effective as telling the earth to slow down its rotation.<br><br>The mother scooped up her little boy and ducked behind a lemonade stand. Fluffy picked up the hot dog without breaking stride and swallowed it in one gulp, then kept on going. Apparently freedom called.<br><br>Montana hurried after her, the new summer sandals she'd bought the week before cutting into her feet. She knew she had to get Fluffy. The dog was sweet, but not very well trained. Montana's boss, Max Thurman, had made it clear that Fluffy was not therapy-dog material. If word of today's disaster reached him, he would insist the dog leave the program. Montana couldn't stand for that to happen.<br><br>Fluffy was a lot faster than she was and quickly ran out of sight. Montana followed the sound of shrieks and screams, making her way through the streets of the town, dodging a peanut cart and narrowly missing a close encounter with two guys on bikes. She turned a corner just in time to see a tail disappearing through the automatic doors of a tall building.<br><br>"No," Montana breathed, staring up at the hospital. "Not there. Anywhere but there."<br><br>She raced forward, inwardly cringing at the thought of what Fluffy could do in a place like that. Big puppy feet on slippery floors were not a happy combination. She ran up the six steps leading to the entrance and dashed inside only to find a trail of havoc marking the way.<br><br>A supply cart was pushed against the wall. Linens spilled onto the floor. A little girl in a wheelchair grinned and pointed down the hall.<br><br>Montana got to the bank of elevators only to find several people willing to tell her that yes, a dog had gotten on. She watched the light panel to see an elevator had stopped on the fourth floor, then jumped in the next one and rode up.<br><br>The doors opened to the sound of screams. A chair lay on its side. More linens were scattered on the floor, along with a couple of charts. Up ahead double doors marked the entrance to the burn unit. Various signs explained what could and couldn't enter that part of the hospital. A joyous bark told her Fluffy had violated every single posted rule.<br><br>Not knowing what else to do, Montana followed the sound and pushed through the doors. Up ahead several nurses were trying to corral the happy dog while Fluffy did her best to lick all of them at the same time. When Montana called her, the dog turned and raced toward her. Just as a doctor walked out of a nearby room.<br><br>Fluffy did her best to stop. Montana saw her puppy paws scramble as the dog tried to slow. But she couldn't get traction on the floor. She started to slide, her butt went down, her front paws braced and then she was zipping along in a sitting position. She plowed directly into the doctor, sending him tumbling into Montana.<br><br>The doctor was about six inches taller and a whole lot heavier than Montana. His shoulder hit her chest, knocking the air out of her. They sailed across the floor, flying a few feet before stopping against the very hard floor, his body slamming into hers.<br><br>Montana lay there, dazed. She couldn't breathe.<br><br>All she felt was dead weight on top of her and a warm tongue licking her bare ankle.<br><br>The man got off her and knelt beside her.<br><br>"Are you hurt?" he demanded.<br><br>She shook her head, then managed to gasp in air. Fluffy moved closer and sat down, looking calm and well behaved. A trick Montana wasn't going to fall for.<br><br>The man reached for her. He ran his large, long-fingered hands up and down her legs and arms, then felt the back of her head. His touch was impersonal, but it was the most action she'd had in months. Before she could figure out if she liked it, she looked at his face.<br><br>He was the most beautiful man she'd ever seen. eyes the color of green smoke, fringed by dark lashes. A perfect mouth, with a strong jaw. His cheekbone&#x2014;<br><br>"She's fine," he said, turning to speak with someone behind him.<br><br>When he shifted his head she saw the other side of his face. Thick red scars grew from his shirt collar, along the side of his neck to his left jaw and cheek. They spiraled, creating an angry pattern that looked painful and pulled his skin.<br><br>She had a feeling her shock showed, but he didn't seem to notice. Instead he grabbed her hand and pulled her to her feet.<br><br>"Dizzy?" he asked curtly.<br><br>"No," she managed, now that she could breathe again.<br><br>"Good." He moved closer. "What the hell is wrong with you? What kind of irresponsible idiot allows something like this to happen? You should be arrested and charged with attempted murder. Do you know what kind of germs that dog has? That you have? This is a burn unit. These patients are vulnerable to infection. They are suffering with a level of pain you can't begin to imagine."<br><br>She took a step back. "I'm sorry," she began.<br><br>"Do you think anyone here gives a damn about you being sorry? Your thoughtlessness is criminal."<br><br>She could feel his rage in every word. Even more scary than what he was saying was the way he was saying it. Not with a loud voice and a lot of energy, but with a coldness that left her feeling small and stupid.<br><br>"I didn't&#x2014;"<br><br>"Think," he interrupted. "Yes, that much is clear. I doubt you think much about anything. Now, get out."<br><br>Embarrassment gripped her. She was aware of the other staff members hovering close by, listening.<br><br>Montana knew that Fluffy's running through the hospital was a bad thing. But it wasn't as if she'd planned the event.<br><br>"It was an accident," she said, raising her chin.<br><br>"That's not an excuse."<br><br>"I suppose you've never made a mistake."<br><br>His gray-green eyes flashed with derision. "Have you ever had a burn? Touched a hot pan or the burner on a stove? Do you remember what that felt like? Imagine that over a significant part of your body. The healing process is slow and what we do here to help it along is excruciating. on this ward, an infection kills. So any mistakes I've made have no bearing on this discussion."<br><br>There was no point in telling him that the work she did was important. She often came to the hospital with therapy dogs. Those therapy dogs helped patients heal, especially children. But she suspected this particular man wouldn't care about that.<br><br>"You're right," she said slowly. "There's no excuse for what happened here today. I'm sorry."<br><br>His mouth twisted. "Get out."<br><br>His complete dismissal stunned her. "Excuse me?"<br><br>"Are you deaf? Get out. Go away. Take your damn dog with you and don't come back."<br><br>Montana was willing to admit fault and take the blame, but to have her apology ignored was just plain rude. Being a screwup didn't mean she was a bad person.<br><br>"You're a doctor?" she asked, even though she already knew the answer to the question.<br><br>The man's eyes narrowed. "Yes."<br><br>"You might want to take that stick out of your ass. It'll make it easier to pretend to be human, which will probably help your patients."<br><br>With that she grabbed Fluffy's leash, ignored the fact that the dog was licking the doctor's hand and walked out of the burn unit, her head held high.<br><br>On her way back to the kennel, she kept a firm grip on Fluffy, but no amount of holding could erase the fact that they'd both messed up big-time.<br><br>Montana loved her job. It had taken her a long time to find out what she was supposed to do with her life. She loved training the dogs, and working with kids at the hospital and older folks at the nursing home. She'd started a reading program at all five local elementary schools.<br><br>She could lose everything because of what had happened today. If the administrator called Max and insisted Montana not be allowed back in the hospital, her boss would fire her. A fair amount of the therapy work took place there. If she couldn't go to the hospital, she wasn't much use to him. And then what?<br><br>She knew she only had herself to blame. Max had made it clear Fluffy wasn't going to be successful in the program, but Montana had wanted to give the dog another chance.<br><br>All her life Montana had been different. On her good days, she told herself she was a little flaky. On her bad days, well, the words were a lot worse than that.<br><br>Regardless of the label, it appeared that nothing had changed. She was still incapable of getting anything right.<br><br></p><h2>St. John&#39;s Gospel: A Bible Study and Commentary</h2><p><p>As Catholics in ever-growing numbers are taking part in Bible studies, many questions arise.

It will tell the story of the mother and child who lost their husband and father to a hit and run, all because a 21-year-old driver was afraid the officer would stop him and find marijuana in his car. Meet the man who has attempted suicide and is entering an inpatient treatment center for his PTSD, the man who stood two feet from his partner when he died from a gunshot wound to the head, the man confined to a hospital for the past year and a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and other officers whose stories continue after the media coverage ends. Enter their homes, their hearts, and their minds to see what they really experience. Learn how their departments, benefits, friends, and families have failed them. Find out what it&#39;s really like to walk the path of an emotionally or physically injured officer and why the belief that every officer is supported and cared for through the thin blue line is a fallacy.

Who defined freedom, and what did freedom mean to nineteenth-century African Americans, both during and after slavery? Did freedom just mean the absence of constraint and a widening of personal choice, or did it extend to the ballot box, to education, to equality of opportunity? In examining such questions, rather than defining every aspect of postemancipation life as a new form of freedom, these essays develop the work of scholars who are looking at how belonging to an empowered government or community defines the outcome of emancipation.<br><br>Some essays in this collection disrupt the traditional story and time-frame of emancipation. Others offer trenchant renderings of emancipation, with new interpretations of the language and politics of democracy. Still others sidestep academic conventions to speak personally about the politics of emancipation historiography, reconsidering how historians have used source material for understanding subjects such as violence and the suffering of refugee women and children. Together the essays show that the question of freedom&#x2015;its contested meanings, its social relations, and its beneficiaries&#x2015;remains central to understanding the complex historical process known as emancipation.<br><br>Contributors: Justin Behrend, Gregory P.

Indeed, much of this imagery has become a literary and cinematic clich� . And what an image it is! <br><br>But its truth is by halves, and paradoxically it is the picaresque imagery of Pyle, Wyeth, Sabatini, and Hollywood that is often closer to the reality, while the historical details of arms, tactics, and language are often inaccurate or entirely anachronistic. <br><br>Successful sea rovers were careful practitioners of a complex profession that sought wealth by stratagem and force of arms. Drawn from the European tradition, yet of various races and nationalities, they raided both ship and town throughout much of the world from roughly 1630 until 1730. Using a variety of innovative tactics and often armed with little more than musket and grenade, many of these self-described "soldiers and privateers" successfully assaulted fortifications, attacked shipping from small craft, crossed the mountains and jungles of Panama, and even circumnavigated the globe. Successful sea rovers were often supreme seamen, soldiers, and above all, tacticians. It can be argued that their influence on certain naval tactics is felt even today. <br><br><i>The Sea Rover's Practice</i> is the only book that describes in exceptional detail the tactics of sea rovers of the period - how they actually sought out and attacked vessels and towns. Accessible to both the general and the more scholarly reader, it will appeal not only to those with an interest in piracy and in maritime, naval, and military history, but also to mariners in general, tall-ship and ship-modeling enthusiasts, tacticians and military analysts, readers of historical fiction, writers, and the adventurer in all of us.</p><p>"As colorful as a Howard Pyle illustration and as compelling as an Errol Flynn film."&#x2014;Michael J.

This accessible framework brings together all the work of an urban school board, including everything from big ideas about core beliefs and theories of action for change to the fundamental relationships and processes through which boards and superintendents work together and the leadership role boards have in building community support for sustained change. Taking into account the hot political arena of urban education, reform governance:</p><ul><li> Helps school board members understand why it is necessary to redesign urban districts and what their role in the process should be.</li><li> Sets forth principles that boards can use as guides to action, and gives real-life examples of how they work. </li><li> Shows how a strong board and superintendent team can work together to be agents for change.</li></ul></p><p><p><strong>Donald R.

Buckley, Jr., Founding Editor, <i>National Review</i> </p> <p> When it first appeared in 1962, <b><i>In Defense of Freedom</i></b> was hailed by Richard M. Weaver as "a brilliant defense of the primacy of the person" and an effective "indictment of statism and bureaucratism." Meyer examines the tension between the freedom of the person and the power of social institutions. In his view, both the dominant Liberalism and the "New Conservatism" of the American tradition place undue emphasis on the claims of social order at the expense of the individual person and liberty. </p> <p> In addition, Meyer insists that liberty is essential to the pursuit of virtue. Therefore, to Meyer, the proper end of political thought and action is the establishment and preservation of freedom.The Liberty Fund edition also includes nine related essays: "Collectivism Rebaptized," "Freedom, Tradition, Conservatism," "Why Freedom," "In Defense of John Stuart Mill," "Conservatives in Pursuit of Truth," "Conservatism and Crisis: A Reply to Father Parry," "Libertarianism or Libertinism?" "Conservatism," and "Western Civilization: The Problem of Political Freedom." </p> <p> <b>Frank S. Meyer</b> (1909&#x2013;1972) was a senior editor of National Review. He was the principal proponent of a "fusion" of libertarian and traditional conservative beliefs in behalf of a concerted challenge to statist tendencies in American political thought. </p> <p> <b>William C.

Moving beyond popular stereotypes of the &#x201c;model minority&#x201d; or &#x201c;forever foreigner,&#x201d; most Americans know surprisingly little of the nation&#x2019;s fastest growing minority population. Since the 1960s, when different Asian immigrant groups came together under the &#x201c;Asian American&#x201d; umbrella, they have tirelessly carved out their presence in the labor market, education, politics, and pop culture. Many times, they have done so in the face of racism, discrimination, sexism, homophobia, and socioeconomic disadvantage. Today, contemporary Asian America has emerged as an incredibly diverse population, with each segment of the community facing its unique challenges. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When&nbsp;<em>Contemporary Asian America</em>&nbsp;was first published in 2000, it exposed its readers to the formation and development of Asian American studies as an academic field of study, from its inception as part of the ethnic consciousness movement of the 1960s to the systematic inquiry into more contemporary theoretical and practical issues facing Asian America at the century&#x2019;s end. It was the first volume to integrate a broad range of interdisciplinary research and approaches from a social science perspective to assess the effects of immigration, community development, and socialization on Asian American communities. This updated third edition discusses the impact of September 11 on Asian American identity and citizenship; the continued influence of globalization on past and present waves of immigration; and the intersection of race, gender, sexuality, and class on the experiences of Asian immigrants and their children. The volume also provides study questions and recommended supplementary readings and documentary films.

Johnson co-starred in some of Hollywood's greatest Western movies of all time, alongside John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen, Marlon Brando, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Burt Reynolds, Alan Ladd, and many more.<p> Known as "Son" to his family and friends, Johnson was the son of a three-time world champion rodeo cowboy also named Ben Johnson. Dividing his time between the world of movies and the world of rodeo, "Son" Johnson became one of the greatest rodeo cowboys of all time, winning the 1953 RCA World Championship for team roping. </p><p> A man of principle who believed in the value of "honesty, realism and respect," Johnson managed to forge a successful career in the film industry without becoming a part of the excesses of Hollywood. He often paid dearly for his integrity, enduring a blacklist by famed Western director John Ford for refusing to allow Ford to verbally abuse him.</p><p> Johnson's career lasted more than 50 years, with many highs and lows, but through it all he always stayed true to the cowboy code. </p><p> When he won his Oscar for The Last Picture Show in 1972, Johnson took the stage and, in his typical "aw shucks" way, said, "This couldn't have happened to a nicer fella." The Nicest Fella is a must read for fans of Ben Johnson, rodeo fans, Western movie buffs, Hollywood fanatics, and anyone who still believes in the American dream!

(Revised Edition)</h2><p><p>"If a mother can kill her own children, then what can be next?" Mother Teresa once asked.</p><p>What indeed?</p><p>Once the value of human life has been depreciated, as in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and the Baby Doe Case, no one is safe. Once "quality of life" is substituted for the absolute value of human life itself, we all are endangered. Already respected scientists are calling for a time period following birth (a week or so) to decide if newborns have "sufficient quality of life" to be allowed to live. Already committees of "medical professionals" would like to decide whether the "quality of life" of the elderly or anyone seriously ill is high enough to allow them to go on living.</p><p>In this moving book, the renowned pediatric surgeon and Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop, M.D., joins with one of the leading Christian thinkers of our day, Francis A. Schaeffer, to analyze the widespread implications and frightening loss of human rights brought on by today's practices of abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia. They see the present as a crucial turning point. Choices are being made that undermine human rights at their most basic level. Practices once labeled "unthinkable" are now considered acceptable. The destruction of human life, young and old, is being sanctioned on an ever-increasing scale by the medical profession, by the courts, by parents, and by silent citizens.</p><p>"But what can I do?" you ask.

Haley's work has garnered many awards, including two Spur Awards (2002 &amp; 2011) from the Western Writers of America. <i>The Tempest</i> is the next thrilling installment in his nineteenth-century American naval fiction series.1. <br><br>The morning watch<br><br>June 6, 1801<br><br>Before he went to sea, Bliven Putnam had wondered why men personify ships, name them, ascribe temperaments to them, refer to them in the feminine. It took only one day at sea in a stiff blow&nbsp;to understand it. When the sails of the <i>Enterprise</i> bellied out and the masts bent before the wind, when the ship buried herself in a trough and then vaulted to surmount a swell, she took on the life of the most spirited filly. A ship at sea&#x2014;you ask things of her, sometimes difficult things, tricky things, and she responds, although not always in the �affirmative. She becomes your home and your safety&#x2014;your only safety&#x2014;in the middle of an ocean. And she not only crosses that ocean, but does so with a grace and touch that is nothing if not feminine. To seamen this relationship with their vessel becomes embedded in their nature. Those who do not go to sea cannot understand it; they accept it readily enough, and they mimic the sailors&#x2019; reference to a ship as &#x201c;she,&#x201d; but they do not comprehend it, really. That is the seamen&#x2019;s bond alone.<br><br>And who can understand an ocean who has not crossed one? A body of water so vast that months peel from a calendar as one dares to traverse it, so mysterious that antediluvian creatures yet to be discovered swim in it, a sea so primal and so powerful that when it rises up in its fury, the tallest and proudest ship is at its mercy&#x2014;no wonder, he thought, that ancient peoples worshipped sea gods.<br><br>Probationary Midshipman Bliven Putnam was fourteen by the calendar, but he appeared and acted years older. The wind was following, lifting the curly, sandy-brown hair on the back of his head, his three-inch standing collar keeping the morning chill off his neck. He was already as tall as many men and as broad in the chest, with a square set&nbsp;to his jaw, his blue-gray eyes conveying determination and quick intelligence.<br><br>He stood his trick at the wheel, his fourth, as he would note with pride in the diary he was required to keep and lay open for Lieutenant Porter, who oversaw his and the other midshipman&#x2019;s schooling. This was the first watch that Bliven had stood alone, the morning watch, the coldest and darkest, with the sparest number of men to watch over&nbsp;the vessel while most of the crew slept. It frightened him badly at first, the responsibility, not having an officer observing him, but in the peace of the wee hours he came to appreciate how little attention a vessel in a good wind requires. He stood with his feet just wider apart than his shoulders, as Lieutenant Porter had shown him, and was aware that he was learning to trust his ship. She was easy to guide, but if he had to force her into a turn it would take all his strength. Five bells brought first light; at six bells the bosun&#x2019;s mate clattered below to light a fire in the galley. The partially stove-in old jack-tar who served them as cook had been on the ship since she was commissioned. He had been an able seaman until a wrench of his back in taking a French privateer had left him with a permanent list to his gait. Thus he had been given the lighter duty as cook and in three years had acquired a skill at it. Seamen valued a cook who could prepare edible food from stores that became progressively more foul the longer they were at sea, and those in the morning watch were content to allow him an extra half-hour&#x2019;s sleep by firing up the camboose for him.<br><br>From his stance at the wheel, Bliven watched the ship come to life. The day bid fair, and crewmen and marines who had been piped awake filed onto the deck, blankets wrapped in their hammocks to be stowed in the netting. The bosun, Josiah Merrick, quietly inspected the sheets and shrouds for any adjustments and directed a detail to set up the elm-tree pump with which they clack-clock, clack-clocked the night&#x2019;s accumulation of water up from the bilges and out the scuppers. Merrick was a small man, but wiry, with auburn hair that tended to fly wild&nbsp;and whiskers that he often had to be reminded, after twelve years of merchant service, were not permitted in the navy. He, too, had been on the <i>Enterprise</i> since her commissioning. He was efficient and even-�tempered, a good buffer between the sailors, who were often inexperienced, bewildered, and hostile, and their often irascible officers. His too was the office of schooling the midshipmen in practical seamanship and boat handling.<br><br>With the sun up and obliquely in his eyes, Bliven understood anew that the <i>Enterprise</i> was a small ship, and they would feel every slap and lurch of the ocean more keenly than they would in a larger vessel. Thus naturally they would cling tighter to her for their safety, but the larger the ship and the greater her reputation, the more intense was her sailors&#x2019; devotion. That was central to understanding seamen, and with Bliven&#x2019;s ambition it took little for him to imagine his future at the helm of a mighty man-of-war.<br><br>A majestic ship of the battle line, seventy-four guns that spread over three decks, masts that tower course on course of sail up to topgallants and royals and then even skysails&#x2014;and, especially when she is girded for fighting, her pennants snapping, guns rolled out, marines in her fighting tops priming their muskets even as they lean against the swell,&nbsp; she inspired a near reverence among her sailors. It is a love that could �ignite tavern duels if a ship&#x2019;s worth or virtue were in the least part questioned.<br><br>But now embarked on his first cruise, Midshipman Putnam was assigned to the <i>Enterprise</i>. Smaller even than the twenty-gun sloops, she was a mere schooner of 165 tons, the smallest class of warship in&nbsp;the American navy. She had only one-tenth the displacement of their flagship, the forty-four-gun frigate <i>President</i>. <i>Enterprise</i>&#x2019;s single-stick masts had just been rerigged as a jackass brig, and she mounted only a dozen guns, little six-pounders. She was eighty-five feet long and seemed barely capable of sheltering a crew of ninety officers and men. There had never been so many, but they had taken on an entire company of marines. The orders that sent them to the Mediterranean were to show the flag and escort American commercial vessels, but no man on board doubted that they were sailing into a war.<br><br>For a decade, the United States had been paying an annual &#x201c;tribute,&#x201d; as it was disgracefully called, to the four Berber states of North Africa: Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. They were collectively known as the Barbary states. Piracy on the open sea had been the mainstay of their national economies for some three centuries. In that time they had taken hundreds of thousands, perhaps more than a million, European Christians captive, held them for ransom, and if they were not ransomed sold them into slavery. They apportioned the women among the warlords&#x2019; harems to spend their youth in sexual bondage, and after that consigned them to drudgery. This the Berbers justified by their religion: Mohammed�anism, known also as Islam. Its adherents were called Musselmen in America, from confusion over the correct name of Moslem. Boldly they proclaimed that their Prophet had given them, the faithful, the right to capture infidels as they pleased, and use them&#x2014;enslave them, kill them&#x2014;as they pleased. In the West, piracy was the criminal act of&nbsp;desperate bands of outlaws; on the Mediterranean, it was the state policy of the Mohammedan countries that claimed the right, exceptional from all other nations, to mastery over the lives and liberty of other nations.<br><br>Mr. President Adams, whom Bliven&#x2019;s father had voted for, supported this policy of tribute and appeasement, with a mind to protect American trade for less cost than building and maintaining a seagoing navy. Thomas Jefferson had been the first to advocate resistance, some fifteen years ago, but his threats were idle, for there was no fleet. The Revolution had been fought at sea almost entirely relying on the French, aided by our own privateers and small warships belonging to the several states. With the federal government created by the 1787 Constitution came the possibility of a national navy, but it was only in&nbsp;response to the Berber pirates, who began attacking American ships at about that time, that the Congress passed the Naval Act in 1794. It provided for the construction of six heavy frigates, with the acquisition also of support vessels. With governmental wavering over the cost, it took years, but now that Mr. Jefferson was president, the pirate states were demanding higher tributes and ransoms, and the United States had drawn a line.<br><br>The <i>Enterprise</i> had left Baltimore on Tuesday, the second of June, 1801, after a delay in fitting the new masts. They were bound for �Gibraltar with the most impressive squadron that their young nation had ever put to sea&#x2014;and that alone said a great deal for the United States, that they could deploy three frigates together so soon after having none. They showed well together, and this was a brilliant morning, the sea reflecting all the interior blues of a sapphire, laced with rolling whitecaps.<br><br>Once the June sun got higher he knew he would be happier not to wear the coat, but now that they had a navy, the officers were keen to display all the polish and discipline of the European fleets. Respect they had already won, when their new ships and green crews mauled the French in the recent battles that they called the &#x201c;Undeclared War,&#x201d; the &#x201c;Quasi-War.&#x201d; This present sortie would be America&#x2019;s first into a theater of action in another part of the world, and the Barbary pirate states were the first enemies they would face that were not of a familiar culture. Stories of American fighting prowess must necessarily precede them, and running a tight ship&#x2014;being seen to run a tight ship&#x2014;would be indispensable in compelling the deference of the renegade Moorish states.<br><br>The <i>Enterprise</i>&#x2019;s lieutenant commandant, Andrew Sterett, had given him the course, southeast by east, and only occasionally did Bliven glance at the compass to ascertain that he had not veered more than a&nbsp;point or two before boxing back to the proper heading. Like all midshipmen, he had a tendency to overcorrect, but the one time this was pointed out to him he learned to steer more conservatively, nudging back to course with the merest suggestive tugs at the wheel. Lieutenant Sterett had marked what a quick study he was, and without being aware of it accorded him a place advanced from his other midshipman. <i>Enterprise</i>&#x2019;s action this morning was lively, invigorating, but not dangerous&#x2014;an ideal time for a probationary midshipman to turn his trick at the wheel. Sterett was careful to keep out of sight and not make him feel too closely hovered over.<br><br>Only fourteen he may have been, but this was far from exceptional. Many boys went to sea when only twelve, and if they persevered they could expect to be commissioned lieutenants at fifteen. Bliven heard steps mounting the single ladder, and saw Sterett&#x2019;s fiery red hair appear, for he did not secure his bicorne hat snugly to his head until he was clear of the hatch. &#x201c;How are you faring, Mr. Putnam?&#x201d;<br><br>Sterett had a penetrating voice, and Bliven started at the sound of it. &#x201c;Very well, sir. I think.&#x201d; Standing his first watch alone at the wheel, it would have been pointless to try to sound confident. Since coming aboard he had paid the strictest attention to the operation of the ship, committing to memory as fast as he could the nautical vocabulary that was the sailors&#x2019; daily language, but which to those on land might as well have been Greek. The best he could appear to be was game to learn, and that at least was accurate.<br><br>Lieutenant Commandant Sterett was a spare man, and slim-waisted. He had a reddish mop of hair, wavy and unkempt no matter how much vanity he expended on it, and bushy combs of red&#x2014;brilliant, almost to orange&#x2014;whiskers, worn straight down the sides of his face in front of his ears, down to his jawline. He had an arcing, beaked nose, a noticeable overbite, and a receding chin&#x2014;an avian countenance not helped by his tendency to move in starts and jerks. There was nothing lacking in his courage, however. Among the crew it was quietly spoken that Sterett, when his blood was up, drew near to madness in his ferocity. During the late Quasi-War with France, when Sterett was serving on board the famed frigate <i>Constellation</i>, he had killed one of his own gun crew, run him through with his sword, when the man flinched from his gun while receiving fire.<br><br>It was no thing to boast of, and Sterett was not the only American officer to have ever done so. The crew of the <i>Enterprise</i>, more than half of them new to the sea, spoke of it somberly, in the manner of an admonition. Their gameness for battle had better match his, or their lives would be equally forfeit. For this summary deed Sterett was savaged in&nbsp;the newspapers, and he was compared to French and even British officers who governed their crews by terror. The journalists found his conduct inconsistent with the principles that led to the revolt against those British. The American navy itself shared this revulsion of the Royal Navy, to the degree that in their own service they determined to recognize no rank higher than that of captain. To have to address anyone as admiral conjured up too many memories of British outrages committed by Admiral Lord This One or That One.<br><br>Lieutenant Commandant Sterett sailed above this storm concerning his conduct. Indeed, he assured one newspaper with perfect equanimity that on his ship, &#x201c;We put men to death for even looking pale.&#x201d; The crew of the <i>Enterprise</i> feared that he meant it, and Bliven knew that the navy would sustain him if he did it again. The day he received his provisional appointment, he also received a pamphlet of the navy regulations, and before reading even beyond the first page he learned that cowardice was a capital offense&#x2014;for officers as well as for the lowly jack-tars.</p><h2>Whatever Happened to Pudding Pops?: The Lost Toys, Tastes, and Trends of the 70s and 80s</h2><p>If you owe a couple cavities to Marathon candy bars, learned your adverbs from <i>Schoolhouse Rock!</i>, and can still imitate the slo-mo bionic running sound of <i>The Six Million Dollar Man</i>, this book is for you. <br><br> <i>Whatever Happened to Pudding Pops?</i> takes you back in time to the tastes, smells, and sounds of childhood in the '70s and '80s, when the Mystery Date board game didn't seem sexist, and exploding Pop Rocks was the epitome of candy science. <br><br> But what happened to the toys, tastes, and trends of our youth?

Lewis on Science, Scientism, and Society</h2><p>Beloved for his Narnian tales for children and his books of Christian apologetics for adults, best-selling author C.S. Lewis also was a prophetic critic of the growing power of scientism in modern society, the misguided effort to apply science to areas outside its proper bounds. In this wide-ranging book of essays, contemporary writers probe Lewis's warnings about the dehumanizing impact of scientism on ethics, politics, faith, reason, and science itself. Issues explored include Lewis's views on bioethics, eugenics, evolution, intelligent design, and what he called "scientocracy." Contributors include Michael Aeschliman, author of C.S. Lewis and the Restitution of Man; Victor Reppert, author of C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea; Jay Richards, co-author of the New York Times bestseller Indivisible; and C. John Collins, author of Science and Faith: Friends or Foes? Praise for The Magician's Twin: "This outstanding book will be of interest not just to C.S. Lewis readers but to anyone following the latest controversies surrounding intelligent design, reason and the mysterious history of human life."--Tom Bethell, Senior Editor, The American Spectator. "This collection of essays shrewdly corrects some misapprehensions of Lewis&#x2019;s views on evolution, the character of reason, and the role of empirical science in adjudicating the answers to life&#x2019;s most important questions. Its greatest service, nevertheless, is foregrounding for 21st Century readers the threats to freedom that unchecked scientism engenders... threats that Lewis so relentlessly and prophetically and bravely warned us about in his era."--Bruce L. Edwards, Ph.D., Professor of English, Bowling Green State University. "The book makes the case that C.S. Lewis, in contrast to many of his critics, had a detailed and consistent view of science and its impact on culture. Lewis was not anti-science; he was anti-scientism... the book is especially important for Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Christians. It points to the battle lines in the science, faith and society debate that in the end is a matter of life and death."&#x2014;Michael H.

Strahan, is the first biography of perhaps the most forgotten hero of the Allied victory. It was Higgins who designed the LCVP (landing craft vehicle, personnel) that played such a vital role in the invasion of Normandy, the landings in Guadalcanal, North Africa, and Leyte, and thousands of amphibious assaults throughout the Pacific. It was also Higgins who, after twenty years of failure by the U.S. Navy&#39;s Bureau of Ships, designed and constructed an effective tank landing craft in sixty-one hours - a feat that caused the bureau to despise him. In 1938, Higgins owned a single small boatyard in New Orleans employing fewer than seventy-five people. Through exceptional drive, vision, and genius, his holdings expanded until by late 1943 he owned seven plants and employed more than twenty thousand workers. Because of his reputation for designing and producing assault craft in record-breaking time, Higgins was awarded the largest shipbuilding and aircraft contracts in history. During the war, Higgins Industries produced 20,094 boats, ranging from the 36-foot LCVP to the lightning-fast PT boats; the rocket-firing landing craft support boats; the 56-foot tank landing craft; the 170-foot FS ships; and the 27-foot airborne lifeboat that was dropped from the belly of a B-17 bomber. Higgins dedicated himself to providing Allied soldiers with the finest landing craft in the world, and he fought the Bureau of Ships, the Washington bureaucracy, and the powerful eastern shipyards in order to succeed. Strahan&#39;s portrait of Higgins reveals a colorful character - a hard-fisted, hard-swearing, and hard-drinking man whose Irishbackground and Nebraska birthplace made him an outsider to New Orleans&#39; elite social circles. Higgins was also hard working, quickly progressing from an unknown southern boatbuilder to a major industrialist with a worldwide reputation. He was featured in Life, Time, Newsweek, and Fortune magazines, and appeared frequently on the front pages of the country&#39;s major newspapers. Even Adolf Hitler was aware of Higgins, calling him the &#34;new Noah&#34;. Through Higgins&#39; example, we see the way technological innovations, politics, labor unions, changing military agendas, and personalities worked together - and sometimes at odds - for an Allied victory. Strahan has based his work on extensive personal interviews with family members, key employees, and other close acquaintances of Higgins, as well as on previously inaccessible Higgins Industries archives. The result is an extremely informative account of one of the key players, and industries, of World War II.<b>Jerry E.

He knew that his new three-year-old son, Adam, was badly developmentally disabled; but he believed in the power of nurture and love. This is the heartrending story, full of compassion and rage, of how his son grew up mentally retarded, a victim of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome whom no amount of love could make whole. The volume includes a short account of his own life by the 20-year-old Adam, and a foreword by Dorris' wife, the writer Louise Erdrich. <i>The Broken Cord</i> won a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1989.Michael Dorris is the author of <em> A Yellow Raft in Blue Water, The Broken Cord, Working Men, Morning Girl,</em> and <em> Guests,</em> and co-author with Louise Erdrich of <em> The Crown of Columbus.</em></p><h2>Dick Francis&#39;s Refusal (Sid Halley)</h2><p>Six years ago, private investigator Sid Halley retired.

He continued his father&#x2019;s legacy with <i>Dick Francis&#x2019;s Gamble </i>and <i>Dick Francis&#x2019;s Bloodline</i>. He lives in England.*Starred Review* In the steeplechase world, &#x201c;refusal&#x201d; means that a horse will not take a jump. Dick Francis&#x2019; son Felix, collaborator with his father on several novels and now the heir to his father&#x2019;s line of mysteries, extends the equestrian definition to the massively banged-up (physically and emotionally) Sid Halley, who stars in a Francis novel for the first time since 2006. Halley, a champion steeplechase jockey who lost his left hand to the double whammy of a fall from a horse and an attack by a thug, long ago turned his insider&#x2019;s knowledge of the race world into private investigative work. But an intense fear campaign directed at his girlfriend made him retire from the track altogether at the end of Under Orders. When the chairman of the British Racing Authority asks Halley to investigate his strong suspicion that races are being fixed, Halley refuses. Even after the chairman is found dead, threats made to Halley&#x2019;s family, and his daughter placed in danger, Halley still refuses, holding onto the safety of his family, which he knows would be blown apart by his investigating the case. What finally tips Halley into changing his mind is entirely convincing, even though it ratchets up the danger for Halley and his family. This is fascinating reading on every level, from the neatly calibrated plot, moving from suspense to terror, to all the details of the racing world Francis provides. Halley is now, as before, an utterly complex, interest-holding character. And the final, moral turn that Francis makes of &#x201c;refusal&#x201d; is brilliant. A heroic return for Sid Halley. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>The Receiving: Reclaiming Jewish Women&#39;s Wisdom</h2><p><p>A highly respected rabbi, therapist, and teacher restores women's spiritual lineage to Judaism and empowers women to reclaim their rightful connection to Jewish teachings, Kabbalah, and to their own spiritual wisdom.</p></p><p><p>Rabbi Tirzah Firestone is the author of the highly acclaimed <em>With Roots in Heaven: One Woman's Passionate Journey into the Heart of Her Faith</em> and is a psychotherapist as well as the founding rabbi of the Jewish Renewal Congregation of Boulder, Colorado. Firestone teaches and lectures nationally on Jewish spirituality. She lives in Boulder with her husband, David, and their three children. </p>The astonishing stories of seven remarkable but almost unknown Jewish women form the centerpiece of this treatise on feminine spirituality. Mystics, sages, prayer leaders and miracle workers, the women lived in the second to 20th centuries, in countries from Germany to Kurdistan. Their recorded legacies survived precisely because they bypassed feminine norms. Firestone, a rabbi and psychotherapist, chose the women based on their abilities to bring life into balance, uniting opposites (practical/spiritual; purpose/action) to achieve wholeness. Each woman's story serves further as a springboard for exploring an aspect of Kabbalah, which literally means "the receiving." Wholeness, says Firestone, is "alive" in this mystical Jewish path that "not only acknowledges the feminine aspects of life, but also the fact that neither the human world nor God can be whole without the marriage of its masculine and feminine parts." To help contemporary women apply the mystical approach to their lives today, she includes practical teachings and techniques. Firestone argues for being connected to "one's fire and sensual wisdom," claiming that the subordination of the body to the spirit has created an "unhealed schism" and a disparagement of women. She admits beginning the book in anger at the ways women have been "devalued and omitted," but as she immersed herself in the women's lives, she says, she found their "determination and positive attitude contagious." Though Firestone's plea for wholeness can become repetitious, she writes convincingly of the power of the feminine to enrich and uplift the world. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II</h2><p>The period 1741-1770, covered by this second and concluding volume, was not one of cloudless sunshine.

A rival food truck owner is in a rage over the competition. The shocking hit-and-run that follows, right in front of Clare's Village Blend coffeehouse, spurs her into action.&nbsp;<br><br>A divorced, single mom in her forties, Clare Cosi is also a dedicated sleuth, and she's determined to catch the ruthless driver who ran down an innocent friend and customer. Then she opens a bag of imported coffee beans and finds ten pounds of rocks--the kind that will earn you a twenty-year jail sentence. Is her ex-husband and business partner smuggling Brazilian crack? Is her staff now in danger? To clear up this murky brew, Clare must sweet-talk two federal agents, dupe a drug kingpin, stake out a Dragon Boat festival, and teach a cocky young undercover cop how to pull the perfect espresso--all while keeping herself and her baristas out of hot water.&nbsp;Coffee. It can get a girl killed. Originally published in hardcover by Penguin, August 7, 2012.</p><p><b>CLEO COYLE&nbsp;</b>grew up in a small town near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

I wanted to shout this, scream it. Risk and I were old friends, and if anyone knew that, my octogenarian employer did.<br><br>&#x201c;Investing in the new coffee truck was my idea,&#x201d; I reminded her between robust hits of espresso. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a smart idea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Now all you must do is convince him.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Him</i> was Mateo Allegro&#x2014;due to arrive within the hour. An international coffee broker, Matt was the Village Blend&#x2019;s coffee buyer, Madame&#x2019;s only child, my ex-husband, and the father of my pride named Joy.<br><br>&#x201c;Like I told you, I tried to convince him . . .&#x201d; (Half a dozen e-mails worth of &#x201c;try&#x201d; to be precise. When text didn&#x2019;t work, I placed calls overseas. Lengthy calls. Enriching AT&amp;T hadn&#x2019;t helped, either.) &#x201c;The man doesn&#x2019;t listen, and he&#x2019;s still in a state.&#x201d;<br><br>Beneath the mauve silk of her mandarin jacket, Madame&#x2019;s narrow shoulders gave a little shrug. &#x201c;What can I say? He&#x2019;s his father&#x2019;s son. All that passion, all that intensity, all that tenacity&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tenacity?&#x201d; I knocked on the coral-colored tabletop. &#x201c;Matt&#x2019;s head could break this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t count on it, dear. For one thing, that&#x2019;s Italian marble. Very <i>old</i> Italian marble. Old things tend to be stronger than you think.&#x201d;<br><br>Sitting back in my caf� chair, I ran my hands along the thighs of my blue jeans and attempted to fill my lungs with a healthy dose of equilibrium. It wasn&#x2019;t easy. The sun may have set, but our coffeehouse commerce was far from winding down. A line of caffeine-deprived customers hugged the espresso bar; and beyond our wall of wide-open French doors, laughing latte lovers still packed our sidewalk tables.<br><br>The city was enjoying one of those glorious stretches of early summer weather, before the high humidity hits, when afternoons are sunny and clear, and nights are pleasantly temperate. Madame and I were perched between the two&#x2014;the warmth of midday and the chill of midnight, when the sun clocks out and a magical light seems to soften New York&#x2019;s hard edges.<br><br>I tried my best to drink in that gentleness, that calm. All day long I&#x2019;d been on my feet, dealing with bickering baristas, demanding customers, and low stock. With the arrival of my assistant manager, Tucker, I finally took a load off, along with my Village Blend apron, to welcome the coolness of early evening with warm sips of caramelized peaberries.<br><br>Unfortunately, a single shot would not be enough caffeine. I wasn&#x2019;t aware of it yet, but something blacker than nightfall was headed my way, and before I knew it, the business troubling me would be murder.<br><br>At the moment, however, the business on the table (literally and figuratively) was coffee&#x2014;and the question of how best to keep this business selling and serving it through the next century.<br><br>So far, Madame had seen things my way. And why not? Despite appearing as starched and restrained as a Park Avenue blueblood, Madame was a bohemian at heart, embracing the odd and offbeat. To her, authenticity mattered more than money. Flouting convention was a virtue; taking risks an asset.<br><br>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;re a war refugee,&#x201d; she once told me, &#x201c;you learn to take chances, to cross boundaries. If you don&#x2019;t dare, you don&#x2019;t survive . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The woman had done more than toil when she&#x2019;d arrived on Manhattan Island. New York City ground up polite little girls like beans through a grinder, and Madame quickly understood that working hard was not enough.<br><br>After her Italian-born husband died young, she learned how to maneuver and strategize. In order to ensure the survival of herself, her son, and this landmark business, she outwitted the scoundrels who thought they could swindle or crush her. And she&#x2019;d won. This century-old business was still thriving.<br><br>As for me, I was no war refugee. I&#x2019;d come to New York from a little factory town in Western Pennsylvania. But I shared Madame&#x2019;s admiration for the virtue of daring&#x2014;and she well knew of my long-standing relationship with the &#x201c;R&#x201d; word.<br><br>At nineteen I risked my future by quitting art school to have my (surprise!) baby. At twenty-nine I risked my security by leaving my marriage to an incurably immature spouse. At thirty-nine I risked my sanity by returning to my old job of managing this coffeehouse, which required working with said spouse. Since I&#x2019;d turned forty, I&#x2019;d risked even more to ensure the safety of my friends, my family, and my staff (a redundant mention since I considered them family, anyway).<br><br>Spending my energy reminding Madame of all that, however, would have been a waste of good caffeine, so I returned my cup to its little round porcelain nest and took a new tack.<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I think?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;No, dear. I only read minds on weekends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re missing the simplest solution.&#x201d;<br><br>Madame&#x2019;s elegant silver pageboy tilted in question.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still the owner of the Village Blend,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;You can break your son down with one firm conversation. Please. When he gets here, talk some sense into him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m his mother, and he respects me. And I could do that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because, my dear, I won&#x2019;t be around forever&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no. Don&#x2019;t start that kind of talk&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Her gently wrinkled hand waved me silent. &#x201c;One day you and Matt will own this building and this business. You must learn how to handle him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Learn</i> how to handle Matteo Allegro? I&#x2019;ve been handling your son since I was nineteen!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You handled a boy, Clare, then a man. A lover, then a spouse. You managed your relationship through a divorce and even his remarriage. But handling a man as a romantic partner is not the same as handling him as a business partner.&#x201d;<br><br>Ready to argue, I opened my mouth&#x2014;and closed it again.<br><br>A single imperious head-shake from my former mother-in-law was reminder enough that further protests would be pointless. This I knew after having spent so many years being a part of this small but remarkable family (my daughter included): Matt wasn&#x2019;t the only Allegro with a head harder than millennial marble.<br><br>&#x201c;Just remember, Clare, conversations about money are never easy when emotion is involved, and in any long-term business relationship, emotion is always involved. But a good relationship isn&#x2019;t about making things easier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then what is it about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Making things <i>better</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>Expelling a breath, I rose to fetch more caffeine. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll stay for our meeting, at least, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Madame passed me the cup and smiled, an insightful little expression that implied her words carried more than one meaning.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere just yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You must be crazy, Clare! Out of your managerial mind!&#x201d;<br><br>Matteo Allegro&#x2019;s Italian-roast eyes were wide with indignation, his voice loud enough to startle my baristas and disturb the peace of my late evening customers.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re overreacting, Matt. Calm down.&#x201d; I lowered my own voice an octave or twelve, hoping he&#x2019;d take my cue. &#x201c;This is simply an expansion. It had to be made.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You threw hard-earned capital out the window to purchase a food cart?!&#x201d;<br><br>On a long exhale, I threw a desperate look his mother&#x2019;s way. <i>Help</i>. Across the table, Madame allowed her gaze to meet mine in simpatico, but her jaw remained set. <i>I warned you, dear. You want this business decision to stand? Prove it should. Handle him.</i><br><br>Shifting in my chair, I stared at the man.<br><br>Matt stared back&#x2014;<i>after</i> swiping aside a dark swath of low-dangling fringe. For years, my ex had kept his hair cut Caesar-short. These days, he wore it longer than a Musketeer. With his return from this coffee-hunting trip, the locks were downright shaggy, plus he had face fur.<br><br>I knew Matt loathed shaving in hot climates, but now he&#x2019;d finally pushed the &#x201c;devilish rogue&#x201d; thing too far. The trimmed goatee had sprouted into a caveman beard. Not that it was any of my business if he looked like he was about to plant a suitcase bomb, but I did think it time he made a date with a barber&#x2014;or a Weedwacker.<br><br>While he&#x2019;d let his hair go, I had to admit, the rest of his body appeared fitter than ever. Under an open denim shirt, his tight white T-shirt outlined his broad shoulders and sculpted chest. Encircling one wrist was a braided leather bracelet given to him by a coffee-growing tribe in Ecuador; fastened around the other, a costly Breitling chronometer.<br><br>Such was the recipe that defined Matteo Allegro: one part daring java trekker, one part slick international coffee buyer. Not that there wasn&#x2019;t more to my ex, but that paradoxical blend epitomized Matt&#x2019;s addictive appeal. At nineteen, I got hooked on the guy. By forty, I found him harder to swallow than a doctor-prescribed horse pill.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to say this again. Try to listen this time, okay? What I invested in was a truck. Not a cart. A gourmet coffee and muffin truck&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not only are you squandering capital, but you actually took on <i>debt</i> to seek out some magical customer base that might not even exist? That&#x2019;s risky, Clare. Risky and reckless!&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, that tweaked me. Matt never held back an opinion, especially a negative one, but a sudden aversion to risk? <i>This</i> from a man who thought nothing of traveling deep into lawless regions of Africa; trekking Central American mudslide zones, diving off the cliffs near Hawaiian volcanoes?<br><br>&#x201c;The Village Blend coffee truck has been up and running for almost a month. And guess what? We haven&#x2019;t lost our shirts&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yet,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Pushing aside my empty espresso cup, I rested one arm on the marble tabletop (and yes, I was betting I could break it with his head).<br><br>&#x201c;In this competitive environment, you either expand or perish.&#x201d; By way of a truce, I rested a hand on his muscular shoulder. &#x201c;I promise you, Matt, I&#x2019;m trying to save the Blend, not ruin us.&#x201d;<br><br>My soft touch appeared to have a favorable effect. The tension in the man&#x2019;s body slackened, and his booming voice finally came down to a semi-normal decibel level.<br><br>&#x201c;Clare . . . We tried expanding once. Remember my kiosks in high-end clothing stores? I do, and not with feelings of nostalgia, either. We lost a bundle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So we failed once. That&#x2019;s no reason not to try to expand our customer base again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you consider advertising?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ad campaigns are ephemeral. What the Blend needs is a long-term strategy for our modern market&#x2014;although, technically, we&#x2019;re <i>post-postmodern</i> . . .&#x201d;<br><br>I handed him a spreadsheet of stats tracking profits since I&#x2019;d resumed managing his family&#x2019;s coffeehouse. With hard work and discipline, I was able to keep costs low and squeeze more profit from every ring of our register. The baristas I&#x2019;d painstakingly trained were making higher amounts of sale to every customer, but the overall number of patrons was not growing.<br><br>&#x201c;I considered opening a second store, but rents are outrageous. The truck solves the problem of choosing a dud location&#x2014;or having a hot neighborhood go cold. If one area doesn&#x2019;t produce a steady customer stream, we simply drive to a new one.&#x201d;<br><br>Matt reviewed the data, exhaled. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your strategy?&#x201d;<br><br>Ignoring the man&#x2019;s skeptical gaze, I mustered the same polite but firm tone I&#x2019;d used on our paper cup supplier when he announced the third price hike in as many months and said&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Proselytizing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a business strategy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a philosophy <i>and</i> a business strategy. We have faith in our Blend, in the quality of our coffee, the commitment to our customers, the century-old tradition of family ownership. We&#x2019;re simply going to spread the word.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br><br>I flipped to a customized map of New York. &#x201c;There are five boroughs in the Big Apple, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Last I checked.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s no way we can get everyone in New York to come to this Manhattan shop, even if it is a landmark business. So Esther and I worked out a day and time schedule for our Muffin Muse truck to go to them. We serve commuters during morning and evening rush. On weekends, there are parks, fairs, and flea markets. We track the revenue at each location, test new locations daily&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On paper, it seems reasonable . . .&#x201d; The man actually sounded conciliatory.<br><br>I glanced at his mother. She slipped me a fleeting wink. Then Matt looked at her and she raised her demitasse, hastily hiding her pleased little smile with a sip of espresso.<br><br>&#x201c;You could have tested this theory out some other way, Clare. A cheaper way. Did you have to invest in a food truck that cost nearly one hundred thousand dollars?&#x201d; Matt&#x2019;s shaggy head shook.<br><br>&#x201c;Believe me, I did my homework on median costs and earning potential. You need to start trusting me on things like this. Have a little faith. You know I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;s a better judge of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, me. We each have our strengths. I don&#x2019;t tell you how to source coffee&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know how to source coffee&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t know a thing about managing at retail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s a load of crap!&#x201d;<br><br>The roar came back, and now he was turning on his mother. &#x201c;Why are you so quiet tonight? Don&#x2019;t you have an opinion? Can&#x2019;t you talk some <i>sense </i>into her?!&#x201d;<br><br>Ack. Little more than an hour before, I&#x2019;d asked her to do exactly the same thing&#x2014;<i>with him</i>.<br><br>For an agonizing minute, Madame sat completely still. My spirits began to flag. <i>Is she going to take his side?</i> Tensely, I watched as she set her demitasse down with a click.<br><br>&#x201c;Clare is not wrong about your lack of experience on the retail end.&#x201d;<br><br>Matt gawked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked in this shop since I was nine years old! Bussing tables, pulling espressos; you&#x2019;re the one who taught me to be the best.&#x201d;<br><br>Madame&#x2019;s features softened at that, but her tone remained resolved. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an exceptional coffee buyer and a fine barista. But Clare is a better shop manager. She&#x2019;s constant and committed yet innovative; fair but firm with staff and suppliers. Clare is also an artist at heart, which means she knows how to see and how to <i>listen</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>The effusive praise struck me numb for a moment. But only me.<br><br>&#x201c;I listen!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What you do is hear, Matteo; it&#x2019;s not the same thing. Clare is also a genius at artful critique.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Artful critique</i>?&#x201d; Matt echoed. &#x201c;What the hell is that&#x2014;a neo-management term? Sounds like a cross between Vincent van Gogh and Donald Trump.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s to do with <i>insight</i> . . .&#x201d; Madame exhaled. &#x201c;My dear boy, you are an excellent coffee hunter, and you clearly adore circumnavigating the globe. But this little patch of ground needs a sovereign, not a Magellan. Clare is here, day in and day out. Business may be good at the moment, but each month brings new challenges&#x2014;and the broader economic picture is far from stable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I assure you, Mother, things...</p><h2>The Ideal Wife</h2><p>In this classic tale, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mary Balogh introduces a hero like no other: Miles Ripley, London&#x2019;s most irresistible bachelor, who&#x2019;s about to lose his heart to the last person he ever expected to love&#x2014;his wife. <br><b><br><br></b>When Abigail Gardiner knocks at the door of Miles Ripley, Earl of Severn, the last thing she expects is a marriage proposal. Desperate, she&#x2019;d come to this charismatic stranger&#x2019;s home to plead for her future. Instead she shocks them both by saying yes. Her impulsive decision will have consequences neither she nor her new husband can foresee. For Miles has his own reasons for marrying her. And Abigail is harboring a secret of her own. As distrust gives way to desire . . . as, together, they give in to the pleasures of the marriage bed, a devastating scandal threatens their future. Now these two wary hearts will risk ruin and disgrace for a love that has changed them both forever&#x2014;the kind all seek, but few ever find.</p><p>Mary Balogh is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the acclaimed Slightly novels: <b>Slightly Married, Slightly Wicked, Slightly Scandalous, Slightly Tempted, Slightly Sinful, and Slightly Dangerous,</b> as well as the romances <b>No Man&#x2019;s Mistress, More than a Mistress,</b><i> </i>and <b>One Night for Love</b><i>.</i> She is also the author of <b>Simply Magic, Simply Love,</b><i> </i>and<b> Simply Unforgettable</b><i>,</i> the first three books in her dazzling quartet of novels set at Miss Martin&#x2019;s School for Girls. A former teacher herself, she grew up in Wales and now lives in Canada.<i>1<br></i><br><br>IF YOU COULD SET BEFORE ME THE plainest, dullest, most ordinary female in London," Miles Ripley, Earl of Severn, said, "or in England, for that matter, I would make her an offer without further ado."<br><br>Sir Gerald Stapleton laughed and drained off the final mouthful of brandy left in his glass.<br><br>"It would be better to be like me, Miles," he said, "and just tell the world in no uncertain terms that you will remain a bachelor as long as you please, and that that will be for a lifetime, thank you kindly."<br><br>The earl sighed and hooked one leg over the arm of the chair on which he sat. "There speaks a mere baronet," he said. "A man without a care in the world. I was one myself until fifteen months ago, Ger. And I used to complain about lack of funds and consequence. I was living in heaven and did not realize it."<br><br>His friend hauled himself to his feet with an effort and crossed the crowded and rather untidy bachelor room that he rented close to St. James's Street to the brandy decanter. His neckcloth had already been abandoned, and his shirt was unbuttoned at the throat. It was late at night, the two men having left White's a few hours before.<br><br>"If that was heaven, you could be living now in a far greater paradise," he said. "You have inherited an earl's title and the three estates to go with it. You have more money than a whole army of princes should decently possess. You are thirty years old&#x2013;in the very prime of life. And of course you still have those looks, which have been throwing females into the flutters and the vapors for the past ten years or so."<br><br>"You have forgotten my most important possession," Lord Severn said gloomily. His brandy was still untouched in a glass at his side. "My mother and my sisters. They are going to be here within the week, Ger, all three of them, and I am going to be leg-shackled within the month. I can hear the chains rattling already."<br><br>"Nonsense," Sir Gerald said. "All you have to do is say no. You are the head of your family, aren't you? The man of the family?"<br><br>"Ah," the earl said. "There speaks a man with no female relatives. Things are not nearly as simple as that, Ger. They worshipped and coddled me all through my growing years, especially after my father died when I was twelve. They have worshipped and loved me through my adulthood. And now they are preparing to show me the ultimate sign of their love. They are going to give me away to another female."<br><br>Sir Gerald yawned and sipped on his fresh glass of brandy. "You have to stand up to them, old chap," he said. "Listen to the advice of someone all of one month your senior. You have to make clear to them that they cannot have your life in exchange for their love. You can't get married, Miles. What is she like, anyway?"<br><br>"Frances?" The earl thought for a moment. "Exquisitely lovely, actually. All blond ringlets and wide blue eyes and pouting rosebud lips. Has her father and her brothers and all their manservants and the village vicar eating out of her hand. She is eighteen years old and about to descend on London to be the belle of the Season and carry off the man of most impressive rank and fortune available&#x2013;me, as it turns out."<br><br>His friend grimaced. "Let's run off to America," he said, "to seek our fortunes. But of course, you already have a fortune. Don't do it, Miles."<br><br>"A man does not know how weak he is until confronted by a parcel of determined and well-meaning female relations, I swear," Lord Severn said. "Am I a weakling, Ger? Am I a doormat? I spent a month at Galloway's before coming here two months ago&#x2013;I went with my mother and Connie. The Galloways have always been particular friends of my mother's. And I found myself lifting Frances up and down from saddles and in and out of carriages&#x2013;she could never seem to use the steps&#x2013;and carrying her gloves and her psalter in and out of church and plucking posies of buttercups and daisies for her to bury her pretty nose in, and doing so many other things that I cringe at the very memory. They are going to have me married to her before the Season is out. And there is not a mortal thing I can do about it."<br><br>"I think we had better run off to America, fortune or no fortune," his friend said, downing the remaining contents of his glass and getting to his feet again.<br><br>"I could feel the noose tightening almost as soon as I had set foot in Galloway's house," the earl said. "It was glaringly obvious why I had been invited there and why Mama had brought me there. It's amazing I escaped at the end of the month without being trapped into some declaration. But now my mother insists in her letter that there was a tacit understanding and that she can scarce wait for it to be made official. Tacit, Ger! What does the word mean, pray?"<br><br>"Galloway and the girl are coming soon too?" Sir Gerald asked.<br><br>"They are all going to be here within the week," Lord Severn said. "And I have the feeling that they are all going to act as if Frances and I have that tacit understanding, whatever it means. I know what it means, actually. It means that we are going to be planning a wedding at St. George's before the month is out, and I am going to be done for."<br><br>"Shall I find out what ships are in dock?" Sir Gerald asked.<br><br>"The trouble is," the earl said, "that I will feel honor-bound. I hate honor, Ger. It always means having to do something one does not wish to do, usually something painful as well as unpleasant. I won't even have to open my mouth to be trapped. I have less than a week of freedom left."<br><br>"I still think you ought just to say a firm no," his friend said. "As soon as your mama sets foot in your house, Miles, just say to her straight out, 'I am not marrying Frances.' Nothing could be simpler."<br><br>"The very simplest thing would be to marry someone else," the earl said. "Run off with her or marry her by special license before my mother even gets here. That's what I ought to do."<br><br>"How did you describe her?" Sir Gerald chuckled. "Plain? Dull? Very ordinary? Is that what you said? Why not a beauty while you are at it, Miles?"<br><br>"Because beautiful women are invariably vain," Lord Severn said, "and think that men were created to fetch and carry for them. No, Ger, my ideal woman is someone who would be nice and quiet, who would be content to live somewhere in the country and be visited once or twice a year. Someone who would produce an heir with the minimum of fuss. Someone who would make all the matchmaking mamas, including my own, fold up their tents and go home. Someone who would quickly fade into the background of my life. Someone I could forget was there. Does that not sound like bliss?"<br><br>"Better still to have no one even in the background," Sir Gerald said.<br><br>"That seems not to be an option." The Earl of Severn got to his feet. "I should be going. It must be fiendishly late. I had better go to Jenny and enjoy myself while I still can."<br><br>Sir Gerald frowned. "You don't mean you are going to give up Jenny when you marry Frances?" he said. "Miles! You are the envy of the whole membership of White's and probably that of the other clubs too. There aren't many who could afford her, and not many even of those that she would cast a second look at."<br><br>"Let's not talk any more tonight about my marrying Frances," the earl said, picking up his hat and cane from a chair by the door. "Perhaps I will meet that woman of my dreams within the next week, Ger. Perhaps I will be saved yet."<br><br>"It's all very well to talk," his friend said, yawning loudly and stretching. "But you wouldn't marry such a creature, Miles. Admit it."<br><br>"Oh, wouldn't I?" Lord Severn said. "A nice, quiet, demure female, Ger? She sounds far preferable to what I am facing. Good night."<br><br>"Give Jenny my love," Sir Gerald said.<br>IT HAD BEEN VERY LATE when the earl arrived at the house where he kept his mistress. And Jenny, having been woken from sleep, had been warm and amorous and had kept him busy until dawn was already lighting her bedchamber. He had slept until well into the morning.<br><br>This was the part of having a mistress that he always liked least, he thought as his steps took him finally onto Grosvenor Square and to the door of the house he had inherited with his title more than a year before. He hated walking home in crumpled evening clothes, feeling tired and lethargic, Jenny's heavy perfume teasing his nostrils from his own clothes and skin.<br><br>He looked forward to having a hot and soapy bath and a brisk ride in the park. But no, it was too late to ride in the park at more than a walk. He would go to Jackson's Boxing Saloon. Perhaps he would find someone worth sparring with, someone to put energy back into his muscles.<br><br>He handed his hat and cane to his butler when he entered the house and directed that hot water be sent up to his dressing room without delay. But his steps were halted as he turned to the staircase.<br><br>"There is a lady in the yellow salon waiting to speak with you, my lord," the butler said, his voice stiff and disapproving.<br><br>The earl frowned. "Did you not tell her that I was from home?" he asked.<br><br>His butler bowed. "She expressed her intention of waiting for your return, my lord," he said. "She says she is your cousin. Miss Abigail Gardiner."<br><br>Lord Severn continued to frown. It was possible. In the two months since he had been in London, having completed his year of mourning for the old earl, who was a second cousin of his father's, and whom he had not known, he had met numerous relatives&#x2013;almost all of them poor, almost all of them with favors to ask. Dealing with them was one of the burdens of his new position that he had not expected.<br><br>He hesitated. Should he merely instruct Watson to pay the woman off? But no. She would doubtless be back again the next week, palm extended. He must speak with her himself, make clear that whatever gift he gave her would be for that one occasion only, that her claim to kinship did not make him responsible for supporting her for life. He sighed.<br><br>"If she is prepared to wait," he said, "then wait she must. I will speak with her after my bath, Watson."<br><br>He turned without further ado and ran up the stairs to his room. He was still feeling depressed after his mother's letter of the day before and after his evening with Gerald. And he was tired after his night with Jenny. Miss Abigail Gardiner would leave the house if she were wise, and not risk facing his morose mood.<br><br>He frowned in thought. Gardiner. Were there relatives of that name? If there were, he had never met any of them. But doubtless the woman would be armed with a family tree to prove his obligation to give her charity.<br><br>Almost an hour passed before he was back downstairs, nodding to his butler to open the doors into the yellow salon. If earldoms and all they brought with them could be hurled into the ocean and drowned, he thought grimly, he would row to the deepest part of it he could find and tie granite rocks about his before tipping it overboard.<br><br>Miss Abigail Gardiner, he saw at a glance, was younger than he had expected. From her name he had expected a thin and elderly and sharp-nosed spinster. This woman was no older than five-and-twenty. She was dressed decently but plainly in brown. There was a faint hint of shabbiness about her clothes. Certainly they had not been made by a fashionable modiste.<br><br>She was a very ordinary-looking young lady, her brown hair smooth beneath her bonnet and almost the same color as it, her features quite unremarkable. She had no maid or female companion with her.<br><br>She was standing quietly in the middle of the room, her hands folded in front of her. He wondered if she had stood there the whole time or if she had sat on one of the chairs for a while.<br><br>She looked remarkably, he thought&#x2013;and the thought afforded him the first amusement he had felt for more than twenty-four hours&#x2013;like the ideal woman he had described to Gerald the evening before. Except that the ideal did not look quite as appealing when it was standing before him in real flesh and blood.<br><br>He set one hand behind his back and raised his quizzing glass to his eye with the other. He favored the woman with the look he had acquired in the past two months as the one best suited to dealing with would-be dependents and hangers-on.<br><br>She curtsied to him but did not, as several of her predecessors had done, continue to bob up and down like a cork.<br><br>"Miss Gardiner," he said. "What may I do for you, ma'am?"<br><br>***<br>"YOU MUST DRESS PLAINLY," Laura Seymour said. "Not shabbily, of course, but not too prettily either, Abby."<br><br>Abigail Gardiner chuckled. "That should not be difficult," she said. "The only clothes I possess that might be described as pretty are at least ten years out-of-date. Will my brown do, do you think?"<br><br>"Admirably," her friend said. "And, Abby, remember what we decided last night. You must act demurely. You really must. I cannot emphasize it enough. He will not be impressed if you are bold."<br><br>Abigail grimaced. "Bobbing curtsies and directing my gaze at the toes of his boots and not speaking until I am spoken to and all that?" she said. "Must I really, Laura? Can I not be merely myself?"<br><br>"One curtsy," Laura said. "And I think you may look him in the eye, Abby, provided you do not stare at him boldly as if daring him to gaze back without being the first to drop his eyes."<br><br>"As I did with Mr. Gill the day before yesterday," Abigail said, and both young ladies exploded into smothered mirth.<br><br>"His face, Abby, when you spoke to him as you did in the schoolroom!" Laura held her nose in an attempt to contain her laughter.</p><h2>The Art of War for Women: Sun Tzu&#39;s Ultimate Guide to Winning Without Confrontation</h2><p><b>Forget everything you <i>think</i> you know about strength, strategy and success. This brilliant adaptation of the ancient masterpiece <i>The Art of War</i> shows women how to use Sun Tzu&#x2019;s philosophy to win in every aspect of life.<br></b><br>Would you like to transform your weaknesses into strengths? Succeed at work without compromising your ethics? Integrate your style and personal philosophy into every action you take? If so, this book is for you. In <i>The Art of War for Women, </i>bestselling author Chin-Ning Chu brings the eternal wisdom of philosopher-general Sun Tzu to women looking to gain a better understanding of who they are--and, more importantly, who they want to be. <br><br>Although Sun Tzu&#x2019;s book is about the application of strategies and determining the most efficient way of gaining victory with the least amount of conflict, every one of those strategies begins with having a deep understanding of the people and the world around us. They also require us to understand ourselves--our strengths and weaknesses, our goals and fears. In other words, the aim is not to apply a series of rules coldly and dispassionately, but rather to integrate ourselves and our unique talents into the strategies we will employ. <br><br>This is not a feel-good book. (But you will feel good after reading it.) It is not a motivational book. (But you will be motivated to achieve what you want, once you are done.) Ultimately, its purpose it to provide women with the strategies we all need to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of our goals and dreams. <br><br>Sun Tzu&#x2019;s <i>Art of War</i> is the most influential book on strategy ever published, selling tens of millions of copies worldwide in several editions. Written by one of today&#x2019;s foremost authorities on Sun Tzu, <i>The Art of War for Women</i> is sure to become a classic in its own right.</p><p>CHIN-NING CHU, an internationally renowned speaker and the bestselling author of <i>Thick Face, Black Heart,</i> is a descendant of Chu Yuan-Zhang, the pauper who became the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty by defeating the descendant of Genghis Khan. The president of Asian Marketing Consultants, Inc., chairperson of the Strategic Learning Institute, and president of Neuroscience Industries, Inc., she was a major contributor to the Discovery Television Great Book series on <i>The Art of War</i>.<b>CHAPTER 1<br>Ji (Planning)</b><br><b>The Elements of Strategy </b><br><i>Before waging a war, the five elements that govern success must be examined. Only then can a proper assessment be done. <br>Those five elements are: 1. Tao (moral standing or ethics); 2. Tien (timing); 3. Di (terrain or resources); 4. Jiang (leadership); 5. Fa (managing). </i><br>The first chapter of <i>Sun Tzu&#x2019;s Art of War</i> contains the core message of the book and includes all the principles that will be discussed in the remaining twelve chapters. Sun Tzu begins this chapter with a discussion of a concept called &#x201c;<i>Ji</i>.&#x201d; (*) Ji has a broad range of meanings: plotting and planning, predicting, comparing, and analyzing. All these elements are part of &#x201c;prewar&#x201d; strategy&#x2014;in other words, they&#x2019;re the steps you must take before you take any action.<br><br>Once you can understand these planning stages of life, the rest of Master Sun&#x2019;s strategies will become second nature. For this reason, I examine his first chapter in depth. According to Sun, five elements govern success and must be understood in the planning stages of any action. <br><br>TAO: Your moral standing and the motivation that drives your actions. If your moral position is pure, colleagues will be willing to go to the mat for your cause. <br><br>TIEN: Timing. There are certain times when you should take action, other times when it is far better to wait. Tien lets you know which way to decide. <br><br>DI: &#x201c;Earth,&#x201d; &#x201c;terrain,&#x201d; or &#x201c;resources.&#x201d; Di refers to the obstacles that you face on your journey to success. Are you traveling over level ground? In other words, is everything going smoothly at work&#x2014;or is each task akin to scaling a great mountain? Di also includes the distances you need to travel to accomplish your goal. <br><br>JIANG: &#x201c;Leadership.&#x201d; Sun Tzu believed that a leader must be wise, trustful, benevolent, courageous, and strict. <br><br>FA: &#x201c;Method&#x201d; or &#x201c;how to&#x201d;&#x2014;what we today would call managing. Your &#x201c;army&#x201d; must be well organized, disciplined, and responsible, and as a leader you must be strong, and merciless in your attempts to maintain order. (Notice that Master Sun has adopted the paradoxical elements of Tao and Fa as part of his strategic thinking. I will explain how you can master the balance between the two.)<br><b><i>Things to Keep in Mind When Adopting Strategy</i></b><br><br><i>Those who carefully calculate their strategies will be led to victory. Those who carelessly calculate their strategies will be led to defeat. <br></i><br>1. <i>None of the strategies in</i> Sun Tzu&#x2019;s Art of War <i>stands on its own</i>. All the elements are interrelated. In other words, strategy is not one-dimensional; it is multidimensional. <br><br>But unfortunately, books can only deliver one point at a time. As you read, you will see how the various pieces fit together. Don&#x2019;t worry, I will help. <br><br>2. <i>Play with the power of paradox</i>. Taoist philosophy, which <i>Sun Tzu&#x2019;s Art of War</i> is based on, recognizes that good and evil are not opposing forces. The opposites are not absolute; rather, they are related&#x2014;just as we know beauty because we have also seen ugliness and know short only as it compares to tall. In Taoism, in <i>The Art of War</i>, there is no right and wrong, no black and white. Every action has its time and place, and the same action will lead to different results when your opponent or other circumstances are different. Confused? Good. This is the first step to understanding <i>The Art of War</i>; you have to give up your attachment to clear&#x2013;cut realities and instead embrace the whole spectrum of colors of paradox and ambiguity. This is the foundation of the art of war and the art of life. <br><br>3. <i>Don&#x2019;t look for rules or consistency. </i>The only rule is, there are no rules. The stories that I use to bring <i>The Art of War</i> to life are provided to increase your understanding; they are not a formula to be followed. The specific subtleties of your situation&#x2014;you, your opponent, your environment, your timing&#x2014;will not be exactly the same as someone else&#x2019;s; therefore, the outcome cannot be the same. When just one element is changed, the entire picture is altered. <br><br>As Sun Tzu wrote: &#x201c;The strategy that provided you victory, may not be repeated in the same way.&#x201d; <br><br>4. <i>Strategy is not about overexercising your brain</i>. It is about understanding your place in the world around you. Think about water flowing downstream into a lake or ocean. There is a destination, but the course will change depending on the terrain. Strategy is not about rules; it&#x2019;s about adaptation.<br><br>With this by way of background, let&#x2019;s delve into the five elements&#x2014;Tao, Tien, Di, Jiang, and Fa&#x2014;in greater detail.<br><b>1.1 <br>Tao (Righteousness)<br>How to Make Winning Decisions<br></b><br><i>Armed with the sense of righteousness and the blessings from Heaven, your army becomes fearless. Thus, they are willing to live and die for the purpose of realizing victory. </i><br><br>Of all the five strategies that make up <i>Sun Tzu&#x2019;s Art of War</i>, Tao is the most important. It is not by accident that Master Sun placed Tao first in his classic book on strategy. <br><br>Tao translates to &#x201c;the way, rightness or morality,&#x201d; but that is only the beginning. Tao is defined as the force behind all creation. As the foremost Taoist philosopher, Lao Tzu, said when describing what we in the West would call God, &#x201c;I do not know what to call Her, I call Her &#x2018;Tao.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>(Note: In ancient Chinese writings all pronouns are implied. So I took the liberty of using the feminine form when it is appropriate.) <br><br>All things good, brilliant, righteous, creative, innovative, ecstatic, sweet, and joyful are rooted in Tao&#x2014;the righteous way.<br><b><i>How Do I Make the Right Decisions?</i></b> <br><br>The question you probably have by now is: How do I use Tao to help me succeed at work? It can be tempting to put short&#x2013; term gains at our jobs ahead of doing what is righteous, but that is always a mistake. And it will almost always backfire painfully.<br><br>When one works against Tao, an ill fate awaits. As the great Chinese philosopher Mung Tzu said, &#x201c;Tao always sides with the righteous.&#x201d; The more Tao we possess, the happier we are, and the more success we enjoy. <br><br>The list that follows can help you in making the right decisions.<br><b><i>The Tao of Decision Making</i></b> <br><br>1. <i>Ask yourself: &#x201c;How righteous is my objective?&#x201d;</i> Every action you take can be measured on a scale of right to wrong. Before making any decision, you must ask what is motivating you. <br><br>For example, you may covet a promotion. But simply desiring a fancy title or a corner office is not consistent or inconsistent with Tao. It is simply a desire. <br><br>Make sure you know why you want the promotion. Is it for the additional pay? More recognition? To thumb your nose at the colleague you have been competing with? <br><br>All those things can be motivating forces; it is even possible that they can provide the drive that can help you move up the corporate ladder. But unless you enjoy doing the work associated with the new position, you are ensuring your defeat. <br><br>For example, in many companies, the title of sales manager is a more prestigious one than that of salesperson. However, if you hate managing people, don&#x2019;t like doing paperwork, and would much rather interact with clients, then a promotion is simply a prescription for disaster. <br><br><i>If you don&#x2019;t have a righteous objective, eventually you will suffer. When you do the right thing for the right reason, the right result awaits.</i> <br><br>Here&#x2019;s an example of righteousness. When Joann (*) left a Fortune 100 company to join a start&#x2013;up, she left a $1 million retirement package behind. But as she told me, &#x201c;It was the right thing to do. I traded a million dollars for a dream.&#x201d; <br><br>That dream initially required her to work longer hours for substantially less money, fewer perks, and no stock options. And in contrast with the security her former employer offered, there was no guarantee that the new company would succeed long term. <br><br>The new firm is now considered one of the best&#x2013;managed, fastest&#x2013;growing companies in the world&#x2014;and thanks to stock options, awarded to Joann shortly after she joined the firm in recognition of the superior job she had done, she is now worth more than $10 million. <br><br>In today&#x2019;s fast&#x2013;moving business world, you are never going to have enough data to make a &#x201c;solid&#x201d; decision, one that is absolutely guaranteed to turn out to be the right choice. When in doubt, I ask a simple question: &#x201c;Is this the righteous thing to do?&#x201d;<br><br>Tao always leads you to victory, although sometimes the right result may take a while to appear. <br><br>2. The second question you must ask yourself before making any decision is: <i>Is this driven by my ego? </i>A supersized ego holds the seeds of self&#x2013;destruction.<br><br>Heir to her family&#x2019;s banking fortune, Alice took over the CEO spot in the business when she was in her late thirties. She was, in short, a disaster. Convinced that she knew better, she refused to listen to opinions of her senior staff that were contrary to her own. <br><br>&#x201c;I grew up in this business&#x201d; was her standard answer when someone questioned her decisions. <br><br>Even worse, she seemed to care more about the perks that came with her office&#x2014;which included a full&#x2013;time chauffeur and cook&#x2014;than she did the business herself. &#x201c;Make sure they know who I am&#x201d; was what she told her assistant every time she went out on an errand.<br><br>It perhaps wasn&#x2019;t surprising that she ran the business into the ground. Her bank was acquired by a far larger one at a fraction of what it had been worth when Alice became chief executive. <br><br>Having failed in her family banking business, Alice was offered a chance to run a paper&#x2013;mill company. (An old friend of her father&#x2019;s interceded on her behalf.) Instead of being grateful, she told the chairman of the board who tried to recruit her that she would not take the job unless she was given a car and a chauffeur. Even after running the family business into the ground, she didn&#x2019;t see that her arrogance was her biggest enemy. <br><br>Alice should have accepted the job and worked hard for her new employer and the stockholders. In the process, she would have proven to herself that the initial failure was an aberration and that she was, indeed, a competent businesswoman. <br><br>3. <i>Am I driven by pure greed?</i> If you are only in it for the money, you will fail. As Confucius said, &#x201c;A superior person understands righteousness, while an inept individual understands only profit.&#x201d; <br>Whenever your motive changes from serving others to greed, you will know your actions are not in line with Tao&#x2014;and failure is inevitable. Here&#x2019;s an example.<br><br>Gloria was the general manager for a five-star hotel in Asia. This particular hotel had a beautiful marble floor covering a lobby that was large enough to hold an ice&#x2013;skating rink. It used to have sofas, tables, and chairs in an area where hotel guests could wait and greet their guests. The lobby was always full of people, and business was good. <br><br>Even though the hotel had a huge coffee shop, as part of a remodeling project, the management turned the lobby into two coffee lounges and removed the waiting area. If people wished to sit, they had to buy coffee at nine U.S. dollars a cup. Each refill was also nine dollars, and the waiters constantly pushed patrons to purchase snacks and desserts while they were sipping their coffee. A casual business meeting for four people, with tax and tip included, could easily cost more than one hundred U.S. dollars. <br><br>It was clear that Gloria had made her decision to eliminate the lobby for only one reason: greed. Gloria&#x2019;s obvious motive was to maximize her revenues. She did not have her guests&#x2019; wellbeing in mind. <br><br><i>Profitability is the goal of every business. However, short&#x2013;term profit can come at the cost of long&#x2013;term success</i>.<br><br>Although I was a friend of Gloria&#x2019;s and had been a frequent guest at this hotel, often spending forty to sixty nights a year there, I found the new practice disturbing and refused to stay there. I could not support a hotel that would not allow my guests to sit with me in the lobby without charging a toll. <br><br>Apparently, I was not the only one who didn&#x2019;t like being held hostage by management&#x2019;s greed. Three years after Gloria put into practice her &#x201c;no&#x2013;free&#x2013;seat&#x201d; policy, the hotel closed one of the two coffee lounges and once again created an area where people could sit and talk. Not surprisingly, business has picked up. <br><br>4. <i>Am I desperate?</i> If you are downbeat, discouraged, depressed, or desperate, it is impossible to come up with successful strategies and ideas. When you&#x2019;re anxious, it is best to do nothing until you can let your anxiety go so that harmony, hope, and optimism&#x2014;the characteristics of Tao&#x2014;can be restored. When you hear your mind chanting &#x201c;I want. I want. I must have,&#x201d; stop. Take a breath and try to gain some perspective. Pretend your life and the work you are doing are someone else&#x2019;s&#x2014; and your desperation will vanish. The more you act from desperation, the less likely you will succeed. <br><br>5. <i>Who will be served and who will be hurt?</i> The more people you serve, and the fewer you hurt, the greater your success. <br><br>Some large companies use their resources trying to trap customers into accepting unfair agreements with fine print that is impossible to read without a microscope. However, in time, consumers get smart. They figure out which company is trying to scam them and which truly wants to serve them. Trying to &#x201c;hook&#x201d; people for profit will ultimately drive customers away. <br><br>Providing a true and useful service to your fellow man (and woman) is the only legitimate path to long-term success. <br><br>The next story about a Taiwanese executive illustrates this point perfectly. Wun Yu Chen, the retired chairman of Known&#x2013;You Seed Co., Ltd., the inventor of the Santa brand cherry tomato, the seedless watermelon, and over two hundred watermelon varieties, built his fortune in the 1960s to 1980s with a booming Taiwan&#x2013;based business. <br><br>In the 1990s he was approached by the Thai government to produce vegetable seeds and fruit in the poor section of northern Thailand. He agreed to do so. <br><br>&#x201c;I made this decision because I wanted to help the Thai people improve their living conditions,&#x201d; Mr. Chen told me. &#x201c;I went into the project thinking &#x2018;if I make money, great&#x2019; but if I lose it, then so be it.&#x201d; <br><br>His motive wasn&#x2019;t to make more money; it was to lessen the suffering of humanity. But because he ran his business in accordance with Tao, the move has proved most lucrative. <br><br>For the last fifteen years, Taiwan has been repeatedly hit by typhoons, wiping out his seed crops there. <br><br>&#x201c;Without the Thailand operation, we would be out of business,&#x201d; Mr. Chen says. Instead, his business consistently turned out a profit. <br><br>By attempting to save the Thai people from poverty, Mr. Chen also saved himself.<br><br>6. <i>What is the Tao of my job?</i> Your Tao, when it comes to your work, is to give it absolutely everything that you have at all times. Think of your paycheck as an agreement to support your employer.<br><br>Every time I say this to an audience of women, I am asked a series of &#x201c;but what if ...&#x201d; questions.

It gives a nostalgic look at the more than one hundred home kits sold by Sears Roebuck in the early 1900s. These homes were offered either as simple kits with only the blueprints and bill-of-materials or as complete homes with all materials and finishes. The architectural styles ranged from simple bungalows to beautiful homes with a strong Frank Lloyd Wright influence. Much of this Wright influence can be traced to the proliferation of Wright homes in the Chicago area, Sears home base. Thousands of these homes are still standing and still providing shelter to families across the country. Many of them are unaware of the source of their home&#39;s design. This book will help them trace their architectural heritage. It will also be an invaluable tool to those looking to trace the architectural history of the American home. is a facsimile reproduction of the Sears Modern Homes catalog.

With few exceptions, black women have been perceived as supporting actresses; as behind-the-scenes or peripheral activists, or rank and file party members. But what about Vicki Garvin, a Brooklyn-born activist who became a leader of the National Negro Labor Council and guide to Malcolm X on his travels through Africa? What about Shirley Chisholm, the first black Congresswoman?<br>From Rosa Parks and Esther Cooper Jackson, to Shirley Graham DuBois and Assata Shakur, a host of women demonstrated a lifelong commitment to radical change, embracing multiple roles to sustain the movement, founding numerous groups and mentoring younger activists. Helping to create the groundwork and continuity for the movement by operating as local organizers, international mobilizers, and charismatic leaders, the stories of the women profiled in <b>Want to Start a Revolution?</b> help shatter the pervasive and imbalanced image of women on the sidelines of the black freedom struggle.<br><b>Contributors:</b> Margo Natalie Crawford, Prudence Cumberbatch, Johanna Fern�ndez, Diane C.

(Emilye Crosby,author of A Little Taste of Freedom: The Black Freedom Struggle in Claiborne County, Mississippi)<br><br>"&#x201c;Want to Start a Revolution? successfully meets its three goals of expanding the boundaries of black radicalism, shedding light on the labor women performed to sustain radical movements, and exploring the gender politics of black women activists (pp. 3-4). Collectively, the essays will provide activists, students, and academic specialists with powerful insights into post- World War II black feminist thought, and the lives of women who joined and guided movements to transform an oppressive society. This collection will also be useful to teachers aiming to introduce students to the politics of historical memory, and the recent distortions of civil rights discourse. We owe a debt of gratitude to the editors and contributors to this collection for reminding us that in the postwar struggle for revolutionary change, as now, women of color hold up more than half the sky."

But one of the most important parts of a minister&#x2019;s job is pastoral care--activities such as compassion, healing, sustaining, guiding, and reconciling people to one another and to God. People today earnestly seek a minister who knows their names and cares about their hurts.Foundations of Pastoral Care introduces both clergy and laity to the ministry skills and personal qualities needed to provide effective care for people inside and outside the church. With thorough examination, Professor Bruce Petersen traces the historical development of soul care from the primitive church and on through the centuries to the church of today. In unit one, he introduces the place of pastoral care in the local church. He emphasizes the unique responsibility of church leaders and pastors to provide spiritual guidance while caring for the physical and emotional needs of their people. In unit two, he examines the pastoral care roles clergy are asked to fill--shepherd, counselor, collaborator, and spiritual leader. In unit three, he addresses the need for a pastoral presence in the life of the church, and in unit four, he concludes with a discussion about the pastor&#x2019;s personal life and the importance of personal spiritual formation.Foundations of Pastoral Care provides the fundamental elements pastors and church leaders need to care for people in meaningful, personal ways with the love, compassion, and grace Christ showed during His ministry on earth.</p><p>Bruce L. Petersen spent 28 years in pastoral ministry before accepting his present position as a professor of pastoral ministry at Mount Vernon Nazarene University. He received his doctor of ministry degree from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. In addition to training students for future ministry, he is a frequent church and conference speaker.</p><h2>Haganai: I Don&#39;t Have Many Friends, Vol. 1</h2><p><p>Recent high school transfer student Hasegawa Kodaka is pathetically inept at making friends.

Realizing that they have no hope of a normal social life, the two outcasts decide to form a group called "The Neighbor's Club" in order to make friends and maybe even learn a thing or two about social skills.

Although survivors may use avoidance strategies to cope with the impact of past trauma, many find that it bubbles up anyway often following other life stressors or a new trauma. Restoring Hope and Trust discusses memories of the past, the role of the nervous system, depression, self-image, and the traumatized worldview, showing clearly how past trauma affects present-day success, happiness, and relationships. This conceptual framework empowers survivors to embark on the healing journey. Restoring Hope and Trust is a compact volume based on a ten-session course that brings old and new understanding together in the psychoeducational approach using simple language, illustrations, awareness exercises, and study questions to guide readers whether they are people on the healing journey or clinicians. Author Lisa Lewis notes the importance of learning new strategies for dealing with past trauma: Too often patients want to jump into the processing [of trauma] before they have found healthy ways of regulating their emotions. It s important to be able to talk about the emotions, but not to be overwhelmed by them. We want the details to eventually bleach out and become more like other memories of what has happened in a persons lifetime....Our goal is to rob the trauma of its power. Restoring Hope and Trust reflects the authors combined 25 years of work with groups of trauma patients at the Menninger Clinic and the Heritage Mental Health Clinic. Author Jon Allen explains: For more than a decade, we clinicians and our patients have worked together in psychoeducational groups to learn about trauma from each other. Each individual brings unique expertise to this endeavor, primarily from life experience. Based on this large pool of expertise personal and professional we have continued to refine our educational program; pe</p><p></p><h2>Fall of the Double Eagle: The Battle for Galicia and the Demise of Austria-Hungary</h2><p><p>Although southern Poland and western Ukraine are not often thought of in terms of decisive battles in World War I, the impulses that precipitated the battle for Galicia in August 1914&#x2014;and the unprecedented carnage that resulted&#x2014;effectively doomed the Austro-Hungarian Empire just six weeks into the war.</p><p>In <i>Fall of the Double Eagle</i>, John R. Schindler explains how Austria-Hungary, despite military weakness and the foreseeable ill consequences, consciously chose war in that fateful summer of 1914. Through close examination of the Austro-Hungarian military, especially its elite general staff, Schindler shows how even a war that Vienna would likely lose appeared preferable to the &#x201c;foul peace&#x201d; the senior generals loathed. After Serbia outgunned the polyglot empire in a humiliating defeat, and the offensive into Russian Poland ended in the massacre of more than four hundred thousand Austro-Hungarians in just three weeks, the empire never recovered. While Austria-Hungary&#x2019;s ultimate defeat and dissolution were postponed until the autumn of 1918, the late summer of 1914 on the plains and hills of Galicia sealed its fate.</p><br></p><p><p>John R.

With orthodox Christians of every age, the author holds that our Lord&#39;s return will be personal, visible, sudden and unexpected, glorious and triumphant. Of three views styled respectively post-millennialism, pre-millennialism and non-millennialism, he advocates the last named as scriptural and shows that it has been maintained by a large majority of the Fathers and Reformers of the Church. In two valuable chapters dealing with the interpretation of prophecy, he points out that the literalist view leads logically to absurdities and is not adopted by the writers of the New Testament, who specifically state that many of the Old Testament predictions have been fulfilled, albeit in a spiritual sense... A general consideration of N.T. teaching on the subject, is followed by a more detailed review of the doctrine of the Gospels, Epistles and Apocalypse, special attention being devoted to the significance of the &#39;millennium of Revelation chapter 20.

While Vladimir Putin has been president and prime minister of Russia, the Kremlin has deployed the security services to intimidate the political opposition, reassert the power of the state, and carry out assassinations overseas. At the same time, its agents and spies were put beyond public accountability and blessed with the prestige, benefits, and legitimacy lost since the Soviet collapse.<br><br> The security services have played a central- and often mysterious-role at key turning points in Russia during these tumultuous years: from the Moscow apartment house bombings and theater siege, to the war in Chechnya and the Beslan massacre. The security services are not all-powerful; they have made clumsy and sometimes catastrophic blunders. But what is clear is that after the chaotic 1990s, when they were sidelined, they have made a remarkable return to power, abetted by their most famous alumnus, Putin.<br><br></p><p><b>Andrei Soldatov</b> and <b>Irina Borogan</b> are cofounders of Agentura.Ru and authors of <i>The Red Web </i>and <i>The New Nobility</i>.

How dangerous is skydiving? And is eating that extra sausage going to kill you? We've all heard the statistics for risky activities, but what do they mean in the real world? In <i>The Norm Chronicles</i>, journalist Michael Blastland and risk expert David Spiegelhalter explore these questions through the stories of average Norm and an ingenious measurement called the MicroMort-a one in a million chance of dying. They reveal why general anesthesia is as dangerous as a parachute jump, giving birth in the US is nearly twice as risky as in the UK, and that the radiation from eating a banana shaves 3 seconds off your life. An entertaining guide to the statistics of personal risk, <i>The Norm Chronicles </i>will enlighten anyone who has ever worried about the dangers we encounter in our daily lives.<br></p><p><b>Michael Blastland</b> is an author, journalist, and BBC Radio 4 broadcaster. He is the author of, with Andrew Dilnot, the popular math books T<i>he Tiger that Isn't</i> and <i>The Numbers Game</i>, as well as the memoir <i>The Only Boy in the World</i>.<br><br><b>David Spiegelhalter, OBE,</b> is Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk in the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge. He is a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, and the Royal Society.Amidst the numbers and stories on topics as diverse as infant mortality, travel, extreme sports, and crime, the authors examine just how all of this affects non-theoretical humans .The whole is seasoned with a dash of humor to create a work that should satisfy anyone curious about just how and when this mortal coil might be shuffled off.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> Tackling a factor in matters ranging from personal choices to public policy, this book's British authors a journalist and a Cambridge statistician, respectively make risk easy to understand without omitting its mathematical basis.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</i></b><br><br> [<i>The Norm Chronicles</i>] is a truly engaging and attention-grabbing narrative that guides the reader through a multitude of helpful and/or curious statistics.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Metapsychology</i></b><br><br> General readers will appreciate this engaging exploration of statistics and their relevance to daily life.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br> Commendable for its wide compilation of facts and figures but perhaps even more so for the authors' deep sense of uncertainties around data, statistics, and evidence.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> You can read this stuff in a prosecutorial tone of voice, if you like, as many writers on perception of risk have: Look how irrational and wrong everyone is! But the authors take a different tack a better one. They argue ably that mathematical computations should be a buttress to our judgment but concede that computations will never, and should never, replace our judgment entirely. Of their risk-buffeted characters, they conclude: We don't know how to use data to tell them how to live.' If they don't, no one does.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> A cheerfully subversive variation on the genre. Chapter by chapter [<i>The Norm Chronicles</i>] does an energetic and laudable job of stretching the mind.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br> They teach us how math helps us sensibly assess and manage risk. Just remember: You can crunch the numbers as much as you like, but when it comes down to any given individual, chance always plays a part.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> Blastland and Spiegelhalter's <i>The Norm Chronicles</i> is irreverent, poignant, insightful, and just about the best book about risk I've ever read. It's also a paradox a book about numbers and probabilities that'll keep you hooked to the last page. That shouldn't be possible. Using master story telling and a large dose of humanity, Blastland and Spiegelhalter transform the statistics of danger and death into a celebration of life. It's a rare feat, but one that's as compelling as it is important. This book is essential reading to anyone who has ever faced the possibility of something going wrong, and thought what the ?!' Buy it!&#x201d;<br><b> Andrew Maynard, director, University of Michigan Risk Science Center</b><br><br> Numbers matter, especially in the face of risk. This book is a powerful remedy for a deadly affliction innumeracy.&#x201d;<br><b> Paul Slovic, president of Decision Research, and author of The <i>Feeling of Risk</i></b><br><br> This engaging, entertaining book clarifies the complicated subject of risk, even as it manages to revel in the complexity. It clears the topic up without dumbing it down. What are the chances?&#x201d;<br><b> Joel Best, author of <i>Damned Lies and Statistics</i></b><br><br> Blastland &amp; Spiegelhalter achieve the amusing feat of bringing mortality data back from the dead. Reading this book will, in all probability, add years to your life.&#x201d;<br><b> Kaiser Fung, author of <i>Numbers Rule Your World</i> and <i>Number Sense</i></b><br><br> We have a really tough time understanding absolute, individualized risk until now. <i>The Norm Chronicles</i> provides a long overdue, systematic, and entertaining dissection of life's risks.&#x201d;<br><b> Eric Topol, M.D., author of <i>The Creative Destruction of Medicine</i></b><br><br> In the same manner that the bumblebee disproved the calculations of an earlier time's aerodynamics, so Blastland and Spiegelhalter refute a central tenet of today's science of risk communication: that the meaning of numbers defies the narrative currency of everyday reasoning. Engaging, enlightening stories of probability, they demonstrate, are the most reliable means for transmitting empirical knowledge of the dangers we face and how to abate them.&#x201d;<br><b> Dan Kahan, Professor of Law and Psychology, Yale Law School</b></p><h2>Death with All the Trimmings (Key West Food Critic)</h2><p><b>The only snow in Key West this Christmas is Hayley Snow, food critic for <i>Key Zest </i>magazine, who is not getting time off for the holiday...or time off from murder. </b><br><br>It may be Christmastime, but thoughts of peace on earth, good will toward men, don&#x2019;t seem to extend to the restaurant biz.

Jackson Brown Jr., <i>Life&#x2019;s Little Instruction Book</i></p><p>My cell phone bleated from the deck outside, where I&#x2019;d left it to avoid procrastinating via text messages, Facebook updates, or simply lounging in the glorious December sunshine with our resident cats, watching the world go by. The biggest interview of my career as a food critic was scheduled for this afternoon and I wanted&#x2014;no, needed&#x2014;to be ready.</p><p>Miss Gloria, my senior citizen houseboat mate, hollered from her rocking chair overlooking the water. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your mother. Shall I answer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mind telling her I&#x2019;ll call back in an hour?&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Gloria would relish the opportunity to chat with her anyway, and maybe her intercession would slash my time on the phone with Mom in half when I returned the call. I am crazy about my mother, honest. But it had still been a shock when she announced she&#x2019;d rented a place in Key West for the winter season. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be so much fun to spend Christmas in paradise together? And New Year&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Martin Luther King Day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Valentine&#x2019;s Day? You get the picture. Mom had followed Diana Nyad&#x2019;s attempts to swim from Cuba to Key West with rapt attention. When Diana overcame sharks, jellyfish, rough water, and advancing age to complete her 110-mile swim on her fifth try, at age sixty-four, Mom took it personally.</p><p>&#x201c;Diana says we should never give up,&#x201d; she announced on the phone a couple of months ago. &#x201c;<i>Why not &#x2018;be bold, be fiercely bold and go out and chase your dreams&#x2019;?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>My mother had been a little down since the summer because her fledgling catering company had not taken off the way she&#x2019;d hoped. Although she&#x2019;s an amazing and inventive cook, the business part of owning a business eluded her. For her first five catering events, cooking with only the highest-quality ingredients, she&#x2019;d lost money rather than made it. A lot of money. Even her newish boyfriend, Sam, who was supportive beyond any reasonable expectation and categorically opposed to meddling, had suggested she take a few steps back and reconsider her plan.</p><p>&#x201c;Why not? You should go for your dream, too,&#x201d; I remember saying. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what you told me when I lost my bearings: Keep putting yourself out in the universe, and eventually the wind will fill your sails.&#x201d; I stopped myself from trotting out more metaphysical tropes. I hadn&#x2019;t wanted to hear too much advice when I was feeling down; Mom probably didn&#x2019;t want mine, either. &#x201c;What do you have in mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking of coming to Key West for the winter!&#x201d;</p><p>Whoa. If that was her dream, who was I to stop her? But my big solo adventure on this island was about to turn into <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>.</p><p>Half an hour after the phone call, Miss Gloria came inside to report on her conversation with Mom, our two cats padding behind. I stroked my striped gray boy, Evinrude, from ears to tail, his fur warm from basking in the sun. His purr box caught and sputtered to life.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s hoping we can swing by in half an hour to look at her condo and have a little lunch,&#x201d; Miss Gloria said. &#x201c;Sam is flying in later tonight, so this may be her best shot at girls-only time for a while. And then she starts her job with Small Chef at Large on Monday. Jennifer&#x2019;s already assigned her to head up a couple of the Christmas parties they&#x2019;re catering.&#x201d;</p><p>Exhibit two: my mother&#x2019;s new job with Small Chef. You had to give her credit for sheer brass guts. How long had it taken me to land my position as food critic at <i>Key Zest</i>? A couple of months at least. And lots of groveling and dozens of sample restaurant reviews. Key West is chockablock with talented, overqualified folks who swarm every decent job opening like roaches to crumbs. And yet my mother had landed a position with the premier caterer in town after meeting her once, at my best friend Connie&#x2019;s wedding reception last spring. She&#x2019;d been here only a week, but I suspected <i>she</i> was already best friends with half the natives on the island. She&#x2019;d probably be designated an Honorary Conch at the next city commission meeting.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me fifteen minutes to finish this up and we&#x2019;ll go,&#x201d; I told Miss Gloria.</p><p>Today I was interviewing Edel Waugh, chef-owner of the new Key West restaurant Bistro on the Bight. I skimmed the review her New York restaurant, Arnica, had scored in the <i>New York Times</i> last spring. Overall, the review glowed with praise, but Paul Woolston, the critic, had ended with this punch to the gut: &#x201c;With bad blood between the ex-husband and -wife co-owners of Arnica, one wonders when&#x2014;not if&#x2014;their personal poison will seep into their food.&#x201d;</p><p>I tweaked the list of questions to ask Edel when we met later, then changed out of my sweats and into a pair of slim-fitting black jeans and a red swing shirt that drew the eye away from the waistline and matched my sneakers. Christmas, just two weeks away, was the one time of year that I broke my own rule about not wearing red because it clashed with my auburn hair. Miss Gloria was waiting for me on the deck, dressed in the first of a deep rotation of Christmas sweatshirts, this one spangled with sequins and glitter-dusted reindeer.</p><p>&#x201c;You look so cute!&#x201d; we said at the same time.</p><p>We locked the cats up in the houseboat&#x2014;things get a little dicier on the island during the high season, with an uptick in partying visitors and in the homeless population&#x2014;and headed down the dock to the parking lot, where I keep my scooter. Miss Gloria began to sing &#x201c;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&#x201d; as she fastened her pink helmet and swung her leg over the bike. As we puttered down Southard Street to the end of the island, Miss G pointed out which Conch houses had been newly decorated for the season. The specialty here, of course, being white lights wound around the trunks of the palm trees. Who could be grumpy on a day like this?</p><p>Ten minutes later, we rolled past the wrought-iron gates and the guardhouse that mark the entrance to the Truman Annex complex, and took a right onto Noah Lane, the last developed street before the Navy&#x2019;s harbor, aka the mole. My mother could not have afforded a seasonal rental in this neighborhood, except that her boyfriend, Sam, had gotten excited about a winter getaway and bankrolled a nice house just blocks from my ex Chad Lutz&#x2019;s condo. When the gates closed at six p.m., there was only one way out of the neighborhood; it would be hard to avoid him. If I wasn&#x2019;t already inured to running into Lutz the Putz, I would be by Easter, when Mom headed north.</p><p>Mom came bursting out of the front door onto her new home&#x2019;s wide wooden porch and hugged us both. &#x201c;My two favorite ladies,&#x201d; she yelped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made chicken salad and cupcakes. Come on, I&#x2019;ll give you the grand tour and we can eat out by the pool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stay long,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I have an interview set up with the chef at Bistro on the Bight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The restaurant opening on the harbor!&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;I read about it in the <i>Citizen</i>. I can&#x2019;t believe my favorite chef in the world will be right here in Key West. I&#x2019;m dying to eat her food again. Any chance&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, Mom.&#x201d; I cut her off and grinned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy to share a lot of things with you, but not my job.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m the food critic for the Key West style magazine <i>Key Zest</i>. It&#x2019;s complicated because we have only four people on staff. One of them, the co-owner Ava Faulkner, despises me and would happily slash me from the masthead at the first opportunity. Next is Danielle, our administrative assistant, who manages all the online intricacies of the magazine and scrambles to keep the whole project from sinking under the weight of Ava&#x2019;s negativity. And last but not least is my editor Wally Beile, who makes my heartstrings and other body parts twang in a most unprofessional way. Though with his own mother dying of cancer, I hadn&#x2019;t seen much of him lately.</p><p>Afraid I&#x2019;d hurt my mother&#x2019;s feelings, I sputtered a little more explanation. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think bringing my mother along on the interview would give the appearance that I know what I&#x2019;m doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, honey,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time, anyway. I&#x2019;ll catch up with her another time.&#x201d; Then she gripped my shoulders and looked into my eyes. &#x201c;I swear, Hayley Catherine Snow, I will not cramp your style while I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom. I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s room for two Snow women on this island.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t sure, really, but I was going to try hard to make it work. Because the truth was, she had always been my biggest fan, and she was a lot of fun besides. And, let&#x2019;s face it, utterly out of my control.</p><p>She spun away, leading us into a spacious living room furnished with expensive rattan furniture, cushioned with pillows covered in pale linen fabric patterned with palm fronds. The kitchen was even more magnificent&#x2014;a bright yellow-and-white-tiled space that included a six-burner gas range, two dishwashers, two ovens, a wine chiller, a bread warmer, and a center island topped in green granite that made me vibrate with envy.</p><p>&#x201c;You could throw one heck of a party here,&#x201d; I said, as we followed my mother onto the back porch. White rattan chaise longues overlooked a perfect little dipping pool shaded by palm trees with an elegant waterfall at the far end.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait until you hear how many events Jennifer has me working,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;She wants me in the kitchen a couple of days a week, of course, but she&#x2019;s already put me in charge of two parties. I&#x2019;m developing the menu for tomorrow&#x2014;a Southern belle&#x2019;s Christmas luncheon. I&#x2019;m thinking curried chicken salad with grapes and pecans, and a green salad, and then for the ladies who don&#x2019;t eschew carbs, big buttermilk biscuits and maybe Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara cupcakes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh swoon,&#x201d; said Miss Gloria. &#x201c;No one in her right mind is going to eschew those carbs. What is a Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara cupcake?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It has to be red velvet, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe with raspberry cream cheese frosting? That&#x2019;s what I tried out this morning. We&#x2019;ll see if you approve.&#x201d; Mom led us to the table, which she&#x2019;d set with shimmery gold place mats, tan polka-dot napkins, and white plates. A bright orange bird of paradise swooped from a clear glass vase at the center for contrast.</p><p>&#x201c;Watch out Martha Stewart,&#x201d; Miss Gloria said with a cackle. &#x201c;You are so clever. It already looks like you&#x2019;ve lived here forever!&#x201d;</p><p>We loaded our plates in the kitchen and brought them out to the poolside table. Mom slid a platter of the pink-icing-slathered cupcakes in the center, to remind us to save room. I spread a thin layer of honeyed butter onto a warm biscuit, admiring the tiny flecks of green scallion in the dough, and then bit into it.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my gosh, these are the best,&#x201d; I said, and then tasted the chicken. &#x201c;And the curry is exactly right&#x2014;a little bite but not enough to put anyone off.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Gloria only rolled her eyes and moaned with pleasure.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh for heaven&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Mom said when we were halfway through lunch. &#x201c;I almost forgot to tell you the other news. You remember my cousin Chuck? His daughter, Cassie, is a pro golfer. She and her husband are popping down to the island for a couple of days this week and I&#x2019;ve insisted they stay with me. And weren&#x2019;t you going to make a dinner reservation at Latitudes when Sam&#x2019;s here this weekend? Would it be a problem to add two more people?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I said, though more people made it challenging to concentrate and harder to manage. &#x201c;As long as they don&#x2019;t mind me ordering and tasting their food.&#x201d;</p><p>Latitudes is the restaurant on Sunset Key, the small private island a stone&#x2019;s throw from Mallory Square, at the very bottom of Key West. Dinner guests have to make a reservation well ahead and then take a water taxi to the island. For me, this dinner would be work more than pleasure, as I&#x2019;d been assigned to review the restaurant for the next issue of <i>Key Zest</i>. I couldn&#x2019;t afford to take a second trip over&#x2014;I had to get what I needed in one visit.</p><p>&#x201c;I know they&#x2019;ll get a kick out of a little window into your world,&#x201d; Mom said. She bit into one of the cupcakes, sighed with satisfaction, and patted her lips with her napkin. &#x201c;I also set up a tee time at the Key West golf course for Cassie and her husband, Joe, and Eric and you. I invited Eric because he and Joe are both psychologists so I figured they would hit it off. I know Eric played a little as a teenager. Your muscle memory doesn&#x2019;t forget that kind of history, right?&#x201d;</p><p>This was crazy in so many ways that I was struck dumb. Well, almost dumb. &#x201c;Back up a minute. <i>I </i>don&#x2019;t play golf,&#x201d; I managed to squeak, because I couldn&#x2019;t say the things that really came to mind. Out loud. To my mother. In front of Miss G.</p><p>Mom laughed, a silvery peal that meant she&#x2019;d started marching down a path and would not be deviating from it. &#x201c;How hard could it be? And, besides, Cassie&#x2019;s a pro. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll be happy to give you some pointers.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p><i>Revenge is like serving cold cuts. </i></p><p>&#x2014;Tony Soprano</p><p>As you might expect from our island&#x2019;s near-Caribbean status, Key West restaurants tend to be casual, with wide-plank floors, doors thrown open to the outdoors, and waiters with tattoos, cutoffs, and weathered faces. Bistro on the Bight had not adopted this trend. The designers had set the eatery apart with clean, spare decor heavy on stainless steel, copper trim, and leather. Orchids bloomed purple and pink on every table, and I noticed no funky odors&#x2014;almost unavoidable in a humid climate when a place had been around awhile. I jotted a few notes on my phone and waved to the server, who emerged from the swinging door that I figured must lead to the kitchen. He was clean-shaven, dressed in a full-body white apron with all black underneath, as though he might have just flown in from New York City. Black is not big on this island.</p><p>&#x201c;I have an appointment with Ms. Waugh. I&#x2019;m Hayley Snow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The chef is expecting you,&#x201d; the server said, and led me to a table for two in the far corner of the room, near the kitchen. &#x201c;Can I bring you a beverage?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks,&#x201d; I said, pointing to the BPA-free water bottle clipped to the side of my backpack. I was still swimming from a second glass of my mother&#x2019;s Arnold Palmer&#x2014;half lemonade, half iced tea, and one of the drinks in the running for her southern Christmas party menu. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to look at the menu while I&#x2019;m waiting, though.&#x201d;</p><p>He crossed the room to the hostess stand and returned with a crisp linen folder.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be with you shortly.&#x201d;</p><p>As he exited through the swinging door, I heard a voice from the kitchen, feminine yet husky with intensity: &#x201c;This is not rocket science. You need to prepare it exactly as I showed you yesterday. Our customers don&#x2019;t want a new adventure every time they order a dish&#x2014;they want what they loved last time and the time before. Exactly as the recipe is written. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Chef,&#x201d; chorused a few voices.</p><p>I began to peruse the pristine pages of the menu and was immediately drawn to the shrimp salad with fennel and orange and a roaste...</p></p><h2>Bridging Theory and Practice in Children&#39;s Spirituality: New Directions for Education, Ministry, and Discipleship</h2><p><p><em>Bridging Theory and Practice in Children's Spirituality </em>explores the different contexts, methods, and situations that influence and foster a child's spirituality and faith development.

Either the man didn&#x2019;t like getting too close to other human beings, or he didn&#x2019;t trust Salinas and was giving himself an avenue of escape if the meeting turned sour&#x2014;in which case he was smart. People who were wary of Salinas tended to live longer than those who trusted him. Drea Rousseau, curled close to Salinas&#x2019;s side, didn&#x2019;t care what the assassin&#x2019;s reasoning was, so long as it kept him at a distance.<br><br>He gave her the creeps, the way he never seemed to blink. She had seen him once before, and at that meeting he&#x2019;d made it obvious he disliked her presence. He&#x2019;d leveled his flat, unblinking gaze on her for so long that she&#x2019;d begun wondering if he made it a practice to eliminate people who could identify him&#x2014;other than the people who paid him, of course, and maybe even them after the money was safely in his hand, or his account, or however assassins collected their fees. She had no idea what his name was, didn&#x2019;t want to know, because while truth was supposed to set you free, in this case she thought it might possibly be deadly. She thought of him as Rafael&#x2019;s assassin, but in fact he wasn&#x2019;t one of Rafael&#x2019;s regular crew; he was a free agent, hired by whoever could afford him. At least twice now, that she knew of, Rafael had met the price.<br><br>To keep from looking at him and maybe finding that unnerving stare locked on her again, she unhappily examined the magenta polish on her toenails. She had put it on just that morning, thinking it would look interesting against the creamy white of the silk lounge outfit she was currently wearing, but the purple undertones were too garish. She should have gone with a shell pink, something delicate and almost transparent to compliment the outfit instead of contrasting with it. Well, live and learn.<br><br>When the assassin didn&#x2019;t reply, didn&#x2019;t rush to assure Rafael that he was honored to work for him the way others had, Rafael&#x2019;s fingers drummed impatiently on his thigh. It was a nervous habit he had when he wasn&#x2019;t comfortable, a telling little gesture, at least as far as Drea was concerned. She&#x2019;d intensely studied his every mood, his every habit. He wasn&#x2019;t exactly afraid, but he, too, was being wary, which meant there were two smart men in the room.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to offer you a bonus,&#x201d; Rafael said. &#x201c;An extra hundred thousand. How does that sound?&#x201d;<br><br>Drea didn&#x2019;t look up, though she quickly processed the offer and what it meant. She went to a lot of trouble to never show any interest in Rafael&#x2019;s business dealings, and when he&#x2019;d occasionally asked her some very casual but leading questions she&#x2019;d pretended she didn&#x2019;t understand what he was getting at. As a result, Rafael wasn&#x2019;t as careful around her as he might otherwise have been. As far as he was concerned, she had no interest in anything that didn&#x2019;t directly affect her, and in a way that was true, just not in the way Rafael thought. He assumed she didn&#x2019;t care who the assassin had killed for him, that she cared only about what she was wearing, how her hair looked, about making Rafael look good by being as sexy and glamorous as she could make herself.<br><br>She was definitely interested in that last part; making Rafael look good in the eyes of others always put him in an expansive mood, a generous mood. Drea studied the platinum and diamond anklet that circled her right ankle, enjoying the way the dangling diamond glittered in the sunlight, the way the platinum glowed against her tanned skin. The anklet had been one of Rafael&#x2019;s gifts when he&#x2019;d been very happy about something. She hoped his pleasure with the assassin&#x2019;s success put him in an equally generous mood; she wouldn&#x2019;t mind a matching bracelet&#x2014;not that she ever hinted. She was always very careful not to ask Rafael for anything, and to ooh and aah over everything he gave her even if it was butt-ugly, because even butt-ugly crap could be sold.<br><br>She had no illusions about the permanency of her position in Rafael&#x2019;s life. Right now she was at the top of her game, mature enough to be womanly, young enough that she didn&#x2019;t have to worry about gray hair or wrinkles. But in another year or two, who knew?<br><br>Eventually Rafael would tire of her, and when he did she wanted to have built up a nice little nest egg for herself, mostly in the form of jewelry. Drea Rousseau knew what it was to be poor, and she intended never to be poor again. She&#x2019;d severed all ties with the girl she&#x2019;d been growing up, white-trash Andie Butts, the target of malicious jokes because of her name as much as anything else, and made herself over into Andrea (pronounced anDRAYuh, which sounded French to her) Rousseau (to go with the fancier pronunciation).<br><br>&#x201c;Her,&#x201d; said the assassin. &#x201c;I want her.&#x201d;<br><br>Her interest caught&#x2014;who was her?&#x2014;Drea looked up . . . and the bottom dropped out of her stomach. The assassin was staring at her with the same cold, unblinking gaze she remembered. Shock slammed into her like a tidal wave; she was the her he was talking about. There were no other women in the room, no one else he could possibly mean. Icy fingers of sheer panic laced around her spine, but then common sense reasserted itself and she relaxed. Thank God Rafael was a possessive man; he would never&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Ask for something else,&#x201d; Rafael said lazily, looping his arm around her shoulders and snuggling her close to his side. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t give away my good-luck piece.&#x201d; He pressed a kiss to her forehead and Drea beamed up at him, almost limp with relief, though she tried not to reveal that for a moment she&#x2019;d been scared almost senseless.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to keep her,&#x201d; the assassin said dismissively, without looking away from Drea&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;I just want to fuck her. One time.&#x201d;<br><br>Reassured by Rafael&#x2019;s immediate rejection of the request, confident once more, Drea laughed. She had a sweet laugh, as harmonious as the chiming of bells. Rafael had once told her she reminded him of an angel, with her long, curly blond hair, big blue eyes, and her bell-like laugh. She used the laugh as deliberately as if it were a weapon, reminding Rafael without words that she was indeed his angel, his good luck.<br><br>At the sound, the assassin&#x2019;s entire body seemed to tense, his attention so tightly focused on her she could almost feel the touch of it on her skin. Until then, if she&#x2019;d thought about it much, Drea would have said he was already alert, but now he was somehow more so, as if all his senses were heightened, his focus so intensi- fied she felt the burn of it on her skin and her laughter choked off as abruptly as if his hand had closed around her throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t share,&#x201d; Rafael said, an irritated note underlying the ease of his tone. The top man never shared his woman; if he did, then he lost an edge, an important one, in the authority he had over his men. Surely the assassin knew that. But they were alone in the penthouse apartment, with no witnesses to what Rafael did or didn&#x2019;t do, so maybe that was why he&#x2019;d thought he could have what he wanted.<br><br>Again the assassin said nothing, merely watching, and though he didn&#x2019;t move there was abruptly something lethal stewing in the atmosphere between them. Curled against him as she was, Drea felt Rafael&#x2019;s almost imperceptible twitch, as if he, too, was aware of the change.<br><br>&#x201c;Come now,&#x201d; Rafael said, his tone cajoling, but Drea knew him well; she caught the uneasiness he was trying so hard to disguise, and because that wasn&#x2019;t something she was accustomed to seeing in him she almost darted an alarmed glance at him, before catching herself and instead inspecting a fingernail as if she&#x2019;d spotted a chip in the polish. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of money to throw away for something so brief. Sex is cheap; you can buy a lot of it with a hundred thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>Still the assassin waited, as silent as a tomb. He had made his request, and the only thing yet to be determined was if Rafael would grant it, or deny him. Without saying a word he made it plain that he wouldn&#x2019;t take the money that had been offered; instead he would walk away, and at best Rafael would no longer be able to call on the assassin&#x2019;s services when needed. At worst&#x2014; Drea didn&#x2019;t want to think about what the worst could be, would be. With a man like this, anything was possible.<br><br>Rafael suddenly looked at Drea, his dark gaze cool and assessing. She sucked in a breath, alarmed by that abrupt coolness, by the assessment. Was he actually considering the idea, weighing the cost if he continued to say no?<br><br>&#x201c;On the other hand,&#x201d; he mused, &#x201c;perhaps I have convinced myself. Sex is cheap, and I, too, can do a lot with a hundred thousand dollars.&#x201d; He removed his arm from around Drea&#x2019;s shoulders and stood, straightening his pants with a practiced movement that made the hem break across his foot at precisely the right spot. &#x201c;One time, you said. I have business across town that will keep me tied up for five hours, which is more than sufficient.&#x201d; He paused, then added lightly, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t damage her.&#x201d; Without even glancing at her again, he walked across the living room toward the door.<br><br>What? Drea bolted upright, unable to think straight. What was he saying? What was he doing? This was a joke, right? Right?<br><br>Drea pinned her desperate, disbelieving gaze on Rafael&#x2019;s back as he walked to the door. He didn&#x2019;t mean it. He couldn&#x2019;t mean it. Any moment now he would turn around and laugh, enjoying his joke at the assassin&#x2019;s expense, never mind that he&#x2019;d almost sent her into cardiac arrest. She didn&#x2019;t care that he&#x2019;d scared her half to death, she wouldn&#x2019;t say a word to him about it, if he&#x2019;d just stop, if he&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Did you really think I was serious?&#x201d;<br><br>There was no way he&#x2019;d give her to the assassin, no way&#x2014;<br><br>Rafael reached the door, opened it . . . and left.<br><br>Barely able to breathe, her lungs constricted by the tide of rising panic that threatened to strangle her, Drea stared blindly at that door. He&#x2019;d open it now, and laugh. Any minute now, Rafael would come back in.</p><h2>Conquering Gotham: Building Penn Station and Its Tunnels</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Superb.

He avoids the pitfalls of excessive theatrics or droning by choosing subtle accents for quotations without making them distracting.

J.A.H. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>In Defense of Miracles: A Comprehensive Case for God&#39;s Action in History</h2><p>Rumors of deception have surrounded claims of Jesus' resurrection ever since the soldiers appointed to guard his tomb made their report to the Jewish authorities. But no one has led the philosophic charge against miracles quite as influentially as David Hume with his 1748 essay "Of Miracles." Refined, revised, restated, his arguments still affect philosophic discussions of miracles today. During the twentieth century, strong arguments have been raised by Antony Flew, now professor emeritus at Keele University in England. Flew has contributed a fresh statement of his objections to the idea of God's acting in history just for this volume, which also includes Hume's classic critique as a part of the case against miracles. In response, Douglas Geivett and Gary Habermas have assembled a distinguished team of scholars to rebut the objections and set forth the positive case for God's action in history: <strong>Richard Purtill</strong> clarifies the word <em>miracle,</em> while <strong>Norman Geisler</strong> critiques Hume's case against miracles. <strong>Francis Beckwith</strong> and <strong>Winfried Corduan</strong> assess how we would recognize miracles in the past and in the present. <strong>Ronald Nash</strong> examines naturalism's exclusion of miracles and shows its self-referential incoherence. <strong>J. P. Moreland</strong> discusses whether science properly rules out the possibility of miracles. God's existence and action in history are probed by <strong>David Beck</strong> and <strong>Stephen Davis</strong>, while <strong>Douglas Geivett</strong> argues that within a theistic framework it is reasonable to expect miracles as confirmation of claims to special revelation. <strong>David Clark</strong> examines miracles within the context of various world religions. <strong>Robert Newman, John Feinberg, William Lane Craig</strong> and <strong>Gary Habermas</strong> conclude by investigating fulfilled prophecy, the virgin birth and incarnation of Jesus, the empty tomb, and the resurrection appearances. <em>In Defense of Miracles</em> is a comprehensive, up-to-date discussion that should not be overlooked by anyone concerned with the current debate over miracles.</p><p>In Defense of Miracles is a comprehensive, up-to-date discussion that should not be overlooked by anyone concerned with the issues surrounding the current debate over miracles.R.

Leading Reformed theologians, such as Kevin Vanhoozer, John Webster, Michael Horton, and Oliver Crisp, offer the &#34;state of the question&#34; on standard theological topics and engage in both exegetical and historical retrieval for the sake of theological analysis. The book represents the exciting new theological trajectory of Reformed catholicity.</p><p><b>"An important contribution to the ongoing renewal of Reformed dogmatics"<br></b><br>"This book is a significant contribution to Christian doctrinal theology.&nbsp;It covers the main loci concisely and competently in a way that makes it suitable for classroom use. I expect it to have a wide usefulness in the years ahead."<br>--<b>George Hunsinger</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"This is an important contribution to the ongoing renewal of Reformed dogmatics in the ecumenical context of our time.

If one imagines that claiming a clear confessional identity is a mark of timidity and narrow-mindedness, here is the refutation! The twelve authors of <i>Christian Dogmatics</i>--through the diversity of their styles and their abundant use of the fathers as well as medieval and modern masters--demonstrate the 'catholic' relevance of Reformed theology.

In their introduction, the editors assert that 'dogmatics is the disciplined effort to have our eyes and mouths retrained by the gospel.'

The book is written as a series of lively, entertaining letters of advice from a sympathetic uncle to a niece or nephew embarking on a government career. <br><br>Kenneth Ashworth draws on more than forty years of public sector experience to provide advice on the daily challenges that future public servants can expect to face: working with politicians, bureaucracy, and the press; dealing with unpleasant and difficult people; leading supervisors as well as subordinates; and maintaining high ethical standards. Ashworth relates anecdotes from his jobs in Texas, California, and Washington, D.C., that illustrate with humor and wit fundamental concepts of public administration. <br><br>Be prepared, says Ashworth, to encounter all sorts of unexpected situations, from the hostile to the bizarre, from the intimidating to the outrageous. He shows that in the confrontational world of public policymaking and program implementation, a successful career demands disciplined, informed thought, intellectual and personal growth, and broad reading. He demonstrates how, despite the inevitable inefficiencies of a democratic society, those working to shape policy in large organizations can nonetheless effect significant change-and even have fun along the way. <br><br>The book will interest students and teachers of public administration, public affairs, policy development, leadership, or higher education administration.

A straightforward narrative of the development of Japanese civilization to 1867, the three volumes constitute the first large-scale comprehensive history of Japan. </p> <p>Unlike the renowned <i>Short Cultural History</i>, it is concerned mainly with political and social phenomena and only incidentally touches on religion, literature, and the arts. The treatment is primarily descriptive and factual, but the author offers some pragmatic interpretations and suggests comparisons with the history of other peoples.</p> <p><i>A History of Japan: 1615-1867</i> describes the political and social development of Japan during the two and half centuries of rule by the Tokugawa Shoguns, a period of remarkable development in almost ever aspects of the national life. Under Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa Shogun, a system of checks and balances to keep the great feudatories in order began to be devised. His successors continued this policy, and indeed the essential features of government by the Tokugawa Shoguns was a determination to keep the peace. Freed from civil war, the energies of the nation were devoted to increasing production of goods in agriculture, manufacturers, and mining.</p> <p>Breaches in the traditional policy of isolation began to occur with the arrival of foreign ships in Japanese waters, the first intruders being the Russian in the 1790s. Thereafter, the government struggled to keep foreign ships away from Japanese ports, but before long the pressure of the Western powers, strengthened by the arrival of warships under the command of Commodore Perry in 1853, forced Japan to take part in international affairs.</p></p><p>Sir George Sansom was a British diplomat and historian of pre-modern Japan.

How does mere matter give rise to all these non-material mental states, including consciousness itself? An answer to this central question of our existence is emerging at the busy intersection of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and robotics.<br><br>In this groundbreaking work, philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark explores exciting new theories from these fields that reveal minds like ours to be prediction machines - devices that have evolved to anticipate the incoming streams of sensory stimulation before they arrive. These predictions then initiate actions that structure our worlds and alter the very things we need to engage and predict. Clark takes us on a journey in discovering the circular causal flows and the self-structuring of the environment that define "the predictive brain." What emerges is a bold, new, cutting-edge vision that reveals the brain as our driving force in the daily surf through the waves of sensory stimulation.<br></p><p><br><strong>Andy Clark</strong> is Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, at Edinburgh University in Scotland.

After he nursed her back to health, she became a ubiquitous presence in Bloomsbury society. Moving with Leonard and Virginia Woolf between their homes in London and Sussex, she developed her own special relationship with each of them, as well as with their pet cocker spaniels and with various members of the Woolfs&#x2019; circle, among them T. S. Eliot and Vita Sackville-West. Mitz also helped the Woolfs escape a close call with Nazis during a trip through Germany just before the outbreak of World War II. Using letters, diaries, memoirs, and other archival documents, Nunez reconstructs Mitz&#x2019;s life against the background of Bloomsbury&#x2019;s twilight years. This tender and imaginative mock biography offers a striking look at the lives of writers and artists shadowed by war, death, and mental breakdown, and at the solace and amusement inspired by its tiny subject. A new edition, with an afterword by Peter Cameron and a never-before-published letter about <i>Mitz</i> by Nigel Nicolson.</p><p><b>SIGRID NUNEZ</b> has published seven novels, including <i>A Feather on the Breath of God</i>, <i>For Rouenna, The Last of Her Kind</i>, and, most recently, <i>The Friend</i>, which won the 2018 National Book Award for Fiction. Her honors include a Whiting Award, a Berlin Prize Fellowship, the Rome Prize in Literature, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters Rosenthal Family Foundation Award. Nunez is also the author of <i>Sempre Susan: A Memoir of Susan Sontag</i>.<br><br> <b>PETER CAMERON</b>&#x2019;s novels include <i>The Weekend</i>, <i>Andorra</i>, <i>The City of Your Final Destination</i>, <i>Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You</i>, and, most recently, <i>Coral Glynn</i>.<b>Praise for <i>Mitz</i></b><br><br> <b>One of <i>NPR</i>'s Best Books of the Year</b><br><br> "Because I enjoyed <i>The Friend</i> so much, when this came across my desk, it really popped out, for a reason . . . [It's a] lovely little edition . . . It's a very lovely portrait of this time in their life, and this time in history . . . It's a very well done, charming book that I would recommend as a palate cleanser . . . It's just a beautiful thing if you're looking for something to pick up and having a hard time choosing the next thing." &#x2015;John Williams, <i>The Book Review</i> (<i>New York Times</i> podcast)<br><br> "A rich little fact-based fiction originally published in 1998, about Leonard and Virginia Woolf and their eponymous rescued pet marmoset&#x2015;a tiny monkey native to South America. Yes, another book about a pet&#x2015;and another ailing pet, at that&#x2015;who's lucky to land with kind caregivers. <i>Mitz</i> is also another wry, supremely intelligent literary gem about devotion&#x2015;to writing, to other people, and between humans and their pets . . . <i>Mitz</i>, like <i>The Friend</i> and <i>Sempre Susan</i>, Nunez's memoir of Susan Sontag, explores the commitment it takes to be a writer, a vocation that often goes unrewarded . . . <i>Mitz</i>, on top of everything else, is a clever homage to <i>Flush</i>. It, too, may have been work, work, work to write, but it's a pleasure to read . . . Like <i>The Friend</i>, <i>Mitz</i> captures the heartrending downside of love and connection&#x2015;loss. But it also reminds us, beautifully, of the 'great solace and distraction' of literature." &#x2015;Heller McAlpin, <i>NPR</i><br><br> "<i>Mitz: The Marmoset of Bloomsbury</i>, a charming, airy, and disarmingly melancholy novel from 1998, has been recently reissued in a new edition by Soft Skull . . . The fictive and the factual are here skillfully threaded as fibers of similar color. The result is historical fiction that avoids the stagy pitfalls of the genre by kindling life from recorded dialogue . . . [<i>Mitz</i> is] a novel of intimate refraction. In plumbing the mysterious affections between species, it comes to represent the solace and fragility of human relations more generally. Synoptic gloss&#x2015;a monkey&#x2019;s antics in Bloomsbury!&#x2015;would devalue the novel&#x2019;s melancholy, which gathers quickly and darkly, like a weather. It is a confection that melts before our eyes." &#x2015;Dustin Illingworth, <i>The Paris Review</i><br><br> "Sigrid Nunez resurrects Virginia and Leonard Woolf's pet monkey, Mitz, in this shining work of biographic fiction. Rescued while sick in 1934, Mitz the marmoset became an integral part of the Woolfs' lives, and the lives of their illustrious, literary friends." &#x2015;Kristian Wilson, <i>Bustle</i><br><br> "On the cusp of World War II, Virginia and Leonard Woolf went to Italy. Leonard was Jewish and Virginia was worried, but they decided, in a flash of daring, to risk a road trip that would take them through Nazi Germany. They were stopped by an officer who became too distracted to ask for their papers after he caught sight of the third member of their party: the Woolfs&#x2019; pet marmoset, Mitz. Sigrid Nunez&#x2019;s <i>Mitz: The Marmoset of Bloomsbury</i> is a biography of this charming, well-connected monkey." &#x2015;Andrew Durbin, <i>Frieze</i>, What We're Reading This Summer<br><br> "<i>Mitz: The Marmoset of Bloomsbury</i> has been called a biography of the Woolfs&#x2019; unusual pet but, as ever, Sigrid Nunez&#x2019;s work defies attempts at a simple synopsis. In the author&#x2019;s witty and fiercely intelligent hands, this novella weaves together fiction and excerpts of actual memoirs, diaries, and letters to become a retelling of Virginia&#x2019;s last years, a philosophical exploration of the relationship between humans and animals, and a portrait of the greater Bloomsbury set." &#x2015;Carrie Mullins, <i>Electric Literature</i><br><br> &#x201c;A lesson to all of us who foolishly believed that Flush exhausted the unpromising genre of pet biography, <i>Mitz</i> takes <i>Flush</i> back to the muse, the marmoset that briefly belonged to Virginia and Leonard Woolf. In prose so lucid, so supple, so exquisitely entertaining we only slowly realize we are in the presence of art, Sigrid Nunez constructs a diagram of love and solicitude and abiding solitude: <i>Mitz</i> is tender, astute, wise, funny, and deeply, unsentimentally sad&#x2015;for all its charm, a novel of masterly formal intelligence.&#x201d; &#x2015;From the citation for the 1999 Rosenthal Family Foundation Award, American Academy of Arts and Letters<br><br> &#x201c;An inventive, intelligent, thoroughly researched and alive creation . . . an absolutely miraculous achievement of intellectual imagination . . . Viva Mitz!&#x201d; &#x2015;Alice Sebold, author of <i>The Lovely Bones</i><br><br> &#x201c;Delight! Nunez is the absolute best. She is the only writer I know with enough delicacy, subtlety, intelligence, and wit to be a marmoset&#x2019;s biographer. I adored this book, as small and as brilliant as that little star, Mitz, the marmoset herself. All this, and with it a splendid portrait of the two Woolfs, Leonard and Virginia, as well. I learned much that is important about marmosets and about the Bloomsbury group from Mitz, and for both insights, I&#x2019;m grateful.&#x201d; &#x2015;Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, author of <i>The Hidden Life of Dogs</i><br><br> &#x201c;The tender biography of a sickly marmoset that was adopted by Leonard Woolf and became a fixture of Bloomsbury society.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times </i> <br><br> &#x201c;In short, glistening sentences that refract the larger world, Ms. Nunez describes the appealingly eccentric, fiercely intelligent Woolfs during a darkening time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br> <br> &#x201c;Though it&#x2019;s factually based on diaries, letters, and memoirs, Nunez&#x2019;s <i>Mitz: The Marmoset of Bloomsbury</i> still offers a slice of pure whimsy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br> &#x201c;Nunez takes great risks with this novel . . .

Domestic vignettes here are nicely turned.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> <i>Mitz</i> succeeds charmingly in portraying the Woolfs&#x2019; companionable writerly routine (as well as their darker days), and in being sympathetic (but not sentimental) toward Leonard&#x2019;s peculiar pet.

Questions for the Soul</h2><p>If you were God for a day, what would you do? If you had to remember the moment in your life when you felt the most alone, when would it be? If you were to name one event that most challenged your relationship with your family, what would you say? If your soul was a color, which color would it be? If you learned that there actually was a Heaven and Hell, what is the first thing you'd change in your life?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate task we face in life is the process of finding and accepting our true selves, our souls. It's often too scary, too overwhelming, or too time-consuming to begin the whole introspective process of self-discovery. So we often don't look. Instead, we do such things as work harder, spend money, eat and drink more, or maybe just clean the house. But what we forget--or maybe never knew--about soul-searching is that this process can be deeply rewarding, fun, and even entertaining. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their bestselling series of If . . . books, If . . . (Questions for the Game of Life), If2 . . . (More Questions for the Game of Life), and If3 . . . (Questions for the Game of Love), authors Evelyn McFarlane and James Saywell have reintroduced the power of the question. These "If . . . " questions have served as icebreakers, after-dinner games, and a platform for intensifying relationships with one's friends, lovers, and self. Now, in If . . . : Questions for the Soul, they present a phenomenal collection of questions that will help you begin your soul search. These questions will inspire and challenge you and guide you to a deeper understanding of your soul.</p><p>When it comes to understanding one's inner spirit, one's <i>raison d'�tre</i>, asking the right questions is often more important than finding the right answers. <i>If...: Questions for the Soul</i> does just that--providing a book full of key questions that can unlock mysteries or at the very least provoke some interesting dinner-party conversations. Questions include the following: <blockquote>If you had to name the single most important ingredient for a spiritual life, what would you say it is? If you were to describe your attitude toward sin, what would you say? If you were to describe a way in which the soul of a person is tested, what would you say?</blockquote> Although authors McFarlane and Saywell (<i>If...: Questions for the Game of Life</i>) avoid inserting their own conclusions or theories, the list of questions has an underlying goal. According to the authors, "This fourth collection of <i>If...: Questions...</i> is designed to help us explore--at our own pace, and to varying depth--that most hidden and essential part of ourselves." As a result, some questions have the weight of serious contemplation, while others offer a playful entry into the lifelong challenge of knowing one's soul. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Evelyn McFarlane was born in Brooklyn and grew up in San Diego.

On the surface, not much, other than consistent success in their fields. But below the surface, they share a common approach to finding, nurturing, leading, and even letting go of great people. The way they deal with talent makes them not merely success stories, not merely organization builders, but what Sydney Finkelstein calls <i>superbosses</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> After ten years of research and more than two hundred interviews, Finkelstein&#x2014;an acclaimed professor at Dartmouth&#x2019;s Tuck School of Business, speaker, and executive coach and consultant&#x2014;discovered that superbosses exist in nearly every industry. If you study the top fifty leaders in any field, as many as one-third will have once worked for a superboss.<br><br> While superbosses differ in their personal styles, they all focus on identifying promising newcomers, inspiring their best work, and launching them into highly successful careers&#x2014;while also expanding their own networks and building stronger companies. Among the practices that distinguish superbosses:<br><br><b>They Create Master-Apprentice Relationships.</b><br> Superbosses customize their coaching to what each prot�g� really needs, and also are constant founts of practical wisdom.

But from space, it is plain that the plateau is a huge crater, and the mountain is its center point.<br> <br>Buried deep beneath that central mountain is a starship. It crashed into the planet Garden 11,203 years ago.<br> <br>Yet the starship was launched from near-Earth orbit only nineteen years ago. It journeyed seven years, then made the jump that was meant to create an anomaly in spacetime and appear near Garden instantaneously.<br> <br>It was instantaneous to Ram Odin, the pilot of the starship&#x2014;the only living person awake on the starship.<br> <br>But compared to the surrounding universe, the ship arrived 11,191 years before it made the jump.<br> <br>In the process, it divided into nineteen ships, one for each of the onboard computers that calculated the jump. All those ships contained a duplicate of Ram Odin, along with all the other humans lying in stasis, waiting to arrive at the world they would colonize.<br> <br>All nineteen ships were deliberately crashed into the surface of the planet Garden. The simultaneous impact slowed the rotation of the planet, lengthening the day. Each impact formed a crater. Protected by anti-inertial and anti-collision fields, all the starships and their colonists survived.<br> <br>Nineteen colonies were created, each separated from the �others by a psychoactive field called &#x201c;the Wall.&#x201d;<br> <br>This starship is in the middle of the wallfold called Vadeshfold.<br> <br><br> <br>The People:<br> <br>In the control room of the starship, there are either four men, or three, or two, or one, depending on how you count them.<br> <br>One of them is the sole surviving Ram Odin. If you say that there is only one man in the control room, he is that man. He has survived all these centuries by rising out of stasis for only one day in each fifty years, or sometimes for one week after a hundred years&#x2014;whatever is needed in order to make the decisions that the ship&#x2019;s computers are not competent to make without him.<br> <br>Another of them looks like an adult man, and speaks like one, but he is really a machine, an expendable. He is called Vadeshex. All the humans in his colony were wiped out in terrible warfare more than ten thousand years before. In the years since then, he has devoted himself to creating a version of a native parasite that might be a suitable symbiotic partner for humans, if they ever came to Vadeshfold again.<br> <br>The two other men were born as a single human being named Rigg Sessamekesh, fifteen years before the present day. Arguably they are not men but boys.<br> <br>Both of them wear upon their heads, covering their faces, the symbiotic facemask created by Vadeshex. The facemask penetrates their brains and bodies, enhancing their senses, quickening their movements, strengthening their bodies, so that some might consider them no longer to be human at all, but rather some strange new hybrid, only half human at best.<br> <br><br> <br>The Situation:<br> <br>A half hour ago, Ram Odin attempted to murder Rigg, but with his faster reflexes, Rigg avoided him. Then, using the time-shifting power he was born with, he went back half an hour in time and preventively killed Ram Odin. It was not just a matter of self-defense. Rigg believed that it was Ram Odin whose actions were destined to destroy the world.<br> <br>Then Rigg went forward two years and saw that eliminating Ram Odin had done nothing to prevent the complete destruction of the human race on Garden. Far from being the worst �menace to the humans of Garden, Ram Odin was the only source of information Rigg would need to figure out how to save Garden. So he went back in time and prevented himself from killing Ram Odin, and Ram Odin from killing the earlier version of Rigg.<br> <br>The result was that now there were two copies of Rigg&#x2014;the one who had done the killing, then learned it had done no good and returned; and the one who had been prevented from doing the killing or being killed, who had not experienced the inevitable coming of the Destroyers, and who now called himself Noxon, recognizing that he could never be the same person as the other Rigg.<br> <br>Thus there are four men, by stature and general shape: Ram Odin, Rigg, Noxon, and Vadeshex.<br> <br>But Vadeshex is not a living organism, so there are only three men.<br> <br>Rigg and Noxon are really one person, divided into two separate beings half an hour ago. So there are only two genetically and biographically distinct men.<br> <br>The Riggs are only fifteen years old by calendar. Older than that by the number of days they have lived through, then repeated, but still they are only boys, not men.<br> <br>And the Riggs are both deeply and permanently connected to the alien facemask, making them by some reckonings only half human, and by other reckonings not human at all.<br> <br>So only Ram Odin, of all the four, is a pure man; yet he is weakest of them all.<br> <br>Far away, in another wallfold, Rigg&#x2019;s sister Param and Rigg&#x2019;s friend Umbo also have power over the flow of time, and are also working to save the world of Garden from the Destroyers. But it is these four in Vadeshfold who among them have control over a starship; it is these four who know that a version of Ram Odin is still alive; and it is these four who must now decide what each of them will do in order to save the human race on Garden.<br> <br>For the one thing that never changes is that, despite many attempts to reshape history by the manipulation of time, the Visitors come from Earth, see what the human race has become in the nineteen wallfolds of Garden, and then send the Destroyers to blast all nineteen civilizations into oblivion.<br> <br><br> <br>The Conversation:<br> <br>&#x201c;The biggest problem we have is ignorance,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what causes the people of Earth to decide to destroy our whole world.&#x201d; Though in fact the biggest problem he was having at the moment was the realization that he was capable of killing someone in cold blood.<br> <br>It was the other Rigg who had actually done the killing, but Rigg Noxon knew that they were the same person. If Rigg had not come back and prevented the killings, Noxon would certainly have done just what Rigg did. Only now, because he hadn&#x2019;t taken those actions, both Noxon and Rigg continued to exist as separate people with nearly identical pasts.<br> <br>Am I a killer, because I know I could and would commit murder? Or am I innocent, because something prevented me from doing it? After all, the person who prevented me was myself. A version of myself.<br> <br>The killer version.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is why your friends have to allow the mice from Odinfold to go back to Earth with the Visitors,&#x201d; said Ram Odin.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re deciding whether to stop themselves from warning the Visitors about the stowaway mice,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer.<br> <br>Ram Odin shook his head. &#x201c;Why is it up to them? You go back and prevent them from giving warning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They had good reason for preventing the mice from getting aboard the Visitors&#x2019; ship,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;The mice weren&#x2019;t going back to find out what happened. They were infected with a disease which was no doubt designed to wipe out the human race on Earth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When you say &#x2018;no doubt&#x2019; it means that there is reason to doubt,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;People only say &#x2018;no doubt&#x2019; when they know they&#x2019;re making a judgment based on insufficient information.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t have facemasks,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t hear the mice or talk to them. They can&#x2019;t ask.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can hear them,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;You can ask.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t necessarily believe the mice,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;They already killed Param once. Our goal is to save the human race on Garden, not provide mousekind with a depopulated Earth for them to inherit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are too many players in this game,&#x201d; said Ram Odin.<br> <br>&#x201c;The mice were planning to take several billion of them out of the game entirely,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not all the players are equal,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;Make a decision and make it stick.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been alone with the expendables far too long,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;You think because you can&nbsp;play God with other people&#x2019;s lives, you have a right to do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You think,&#x201d; added Rigg-the-killer, &#x201c;that because you&#x2019;ve been doing it for so long, you&#x2019;re fit to do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Power is power,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;If you have it, then it&#x2019;s yours to use.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The sheer stupidity of that statement,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer, &#x201c;makes me wonder how Garden struggled along for eleven thousand years with you in control.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A child lectures an eleven-thousand-year-old man,&#x201d; said Ram Odin.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are thousands of examples in history,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer, &#x201c;of people with power who used it in ways that ended up destroying their power and, usually, a whole lot of innocent �people, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rigg Noxon listened to his other self and realized: Having killed Ram Odin changed him. Rigg Noxon would not have treated Ram that way&#x2014;as if his statements were worthless. Rigg Noxon would have tried to take them into account. Rigg Noxon would have spoken as youth to adult. But Rigg-the-killer must still be full of anger toward Ram Odin, who had, after all, tried to kill Rigg first.<br> <br>We lived exactly the same life until a few minutes ago, for me; a few weeks or months ago, for Rigg-the-killer. But we are different people.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you leave the decision up to Umbo and Param,&#x201d; said Ram Odin.<br> <br>&#x201c;And Olivenko and Loaf,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re companions, not a military force with someone giving orders and everyone else required to obey.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to leave the future of the human race on both planets in the tiny little hands of the sentient mice of Odinfold.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you plan, then?&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;To sneak on board the Visitors&#x2019; ship?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon, at exactly the same moment.<br> <br>They looked at each other in consternation.<br> <br>&#x201c;We could sneak on,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;We can slice time the way Param does, now that we have the facemask to let us perceive units of time that small. We&#x2019;ll be invisible for the whole voyage back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And when we get there, what will we do?&#x201d; asked Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;There is only a year between the coming of the Visitors and the return of the Destroyers. Most of that must have been spent voyaging. So when they return to Earth, the response, the decision, it&#x2019;s immediate. What are we going to do, give speeches? Hold meetings?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your talents with time don&#x2019;t make you particularly persuasive,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;And powerful people don&#x2019;t change their minds because of speeches.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As soon as we arrive,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer, &#x201c;we jump back in time and learn everything we need to know, make the connections we need to make.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll fit right in. Nobody will notice we&#x2019;re from another planet. I&#x2019;m sure that in all human cultures, kids our age will be taken seriously and be able to influence world events. Especially kids wearing parasites on their faces.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or you could figure out who needs to be assassinated and kill them,&#x201d; said Ram Odin.<br> <br>Both Riggs looked at him in consternation. &#x201c;We know you&#x2019;re an assassin,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On the contrary,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;You came here bragging that you are.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In self-defense,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;But you&#x2014;when your ship made the jump and you realized that there were nineteen copies of the ship, of you, of all the colonists, you made the immediate decision to kill all the other versions of yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Precisely to avoid the kind of weak-minded, incoherent &#x2018;leadership&#x2019; you exhibit,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;And please remember, I&#x2019;m the Ram Odin who didn&#x2019;t order the death of anybody.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re the sneaky one who hid out until the quickest killer version of yourself had died of old age and then you established your colony in Odinfold, violating most of the decisions your murderous self made and then living forever,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;Proving that you don&#x2019;t always think one person is fit to make all the decisions for everyone&#x2014;even when that person is a version of yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ram Odin rolled his eyes and then nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s extremely annoying hearing this from a child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But no less true,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Once you&#x2019;ve killed somebody,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon, &#x201c;can anybody honestly consider you a child anymore?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;re still a child because I stopped you from killing anybody? And I&#x2019;m an adult?&#x201d; asked Rigg-the-killer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;In a way. Maybe because I&#x2019;m a child, or maybe because of the quirks of causality arising from the different paths we&#x2019;ve walked recently, I have a slightly different plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Either we go back with the Visitors or we don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;The difference isn&#x2019;t slight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be like him,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon, &#x201c;and assume that because you didn&#x2019;t think of it, it must be wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Think of what?&#x201d; asked Ram Odin impatiently.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I should go to Earth, but not with the Visitors,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon.<br> <br>A couple of beats of silence, and then Ram Odin shook his head. &#x201c;This ship can&#x2019;t fly again. The inertial field kept it from damage when it collided with Garden, but we can&#x2019;t raise it from the planet&#x2019;s surface. Even if we could get rid of the millions of tons of rock above us right now, the ship doesn&#x2019;t have enough power to lift us out of the gravity well of Garden.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rigg Noxon shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re forgetting what we do,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;He means for one of us to go backward in time to when the ship arrived,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;He means for us to keep making little jumps into the past, following your path moment by moment, backward along with this ship as it slammed into Garden. I mean, as it unslams, backing out of this hole and up into space, backward and backward until it gets to Earth. Until we get to the point where you launched on this voyage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This ship was built in space,&#x201d; said Ram Odin. &#x201c;It never was on Earth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We go back to when it was built,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;Then we follow someone else&#x2019;s path off the ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you can even do that,&#x201d; said Ram Odin, &#x201c;what&#x2019;s the point? Why not go back with the Visitors as the other Rigg suggested and then jump back in time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are some key differences,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon. &#x201c;First, we don&#x2019;t have to spend the voyage in hiding&#x2014;not the way we would by slicing time on the Visitors&#x2019; ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rigg-the-killer was nodding. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll have the jewels,&#x201d; he said, holding up the bag of jewels that gave them the ability to control the ships&#x2019; computers&#x2014;and stored all the information the computers had gathered in the meantime.<br> <br>Ram Odin looked at the jewels. &#x201c;Each time you jump backward,&#x201d; said Ram Odin, &#x201c;the ships&#x2019; computers and the expendables will be sensing these things for the first time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And each time,&#x201d; said Rigg Noxon, &#x201c;it will give them a complete account of everything that&#x2019;s been learned in the eleven millennia of history on Garden.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So they can take preventive measures and cause us all not to exist?&#x201d; asked Ram Odin.<br> <br>&#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t cause us not to exist,&#x201d; said Rigg-the-killer. &#x201c;Preservation of causality and all that. But yes, it might cause them to prevent the terraforming of Garden in the first place.

You&#x2019;d better come out!" <br><br>Harriet knows who is yelling &#x2014; the Ku Klux Klan men wearing masks, tall pointed caps, and long white robes. <br><br>Her oldest son wakes and ducks under the mattress. The baby wakes and starts to fuss. Her husband darts out of bed, loosens three floorboards, and jumps into the hiding place they prepared months ago. She replaces the planks. She steps into her skirt to cover her nightshirt, but she is so flustered she gets entangled in the material. <br><br>"Postle! Open up this door! You can&#x2019;t hide from us!"<br><br>Harriet scoops up the baby and plops down in a chair over the hiding place. She puts her hands over the baby&#x2019;s ears, trying to block out the furious banging.<br><br>The door crashes in. Four men in dusty boots point pistols at the mattress, under which her son cowers.<br><br>"Leave my boy alone!" she shouts.<br><br>One man jerks her chair out from under her. <br><br>She falls to the floor, hugging her baby. The man stomps his foot on her huge stomach. "Where is your husband?" <br><br>"He&#x2019;s not here!" <br><br>He drops a rope shaped like a noose over her neck. "Tell me where he is." Her son is screaming and sobbing at the same time. The baby wails. The man presses harder on her stomach. "Where is he?" <br><br>She does not answer.

A glance at the wicker chair to her right simply confirmed that observation.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard that, you know.&#x201d; Claire Weatherly smoothed her hand over the simple late-summer dress she&#x2019;d almost forgotten she owned and abandoned the porch swing. &#x201c;And while I probably should say something about you being every bit as incorrigible as Grandma ever was, I&#x2019;m just going to say I feel exactly the same way when I see him. Times a hundred.&#x201d;</p><p>Diane Weatherly stilled her knitting needles. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t looking at Detective Fisher, dear.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire darted her own attention back to the parking lot just long enough to confirm Jakob had exited his car but was still just out of earshot. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I was looking at you, dear.&#x201d; Tucking her needles into the multicolored ball of yarn wedged between her knees, the sixty-two-year-old woman tilted her head down just enough to afford an uninhibited view of Claire across the top of her reading glasses. &#x201c;One day, when you have a child of your own, you&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s mighty cryptic, Aunt Diane.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just the best defense I can offer.&#x201d; Diane&#x2019;s thinning lips twitched with a grin just before her eyes led Claire&#x2019;s back to the handsome man now no more than three strides away from the porch steps. &#x201c;Now, go give him a proper greeting so I can sigh in peace.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire tried to nibble back a laugh but it was no use. Instead, she closed the gap between them, kissed the top of her aunt&#x2019;s head, and then turned back toward the steps as a still-smiling Jakob reached the top. &#x201c;You look mighty happy this morning. Is it from seeing me or knowing that she&#x201d;&#x2014;Claire hooked her thumb at first Diane and then the waiting picnic basket on the floor beneath the swing&#x2014;&#x201c;can&#x2019;t help but toss in a few extra goodies earmarked especially for you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That depends. What are these extra goodies of which you speak?&#x201d; Then, pulling her toward him before her answering gasp could gain much momentum, he stemmed the rest with a sweet kiss. &#x201c;Mmmm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You taste good.&#x201d;</p><p>Bracing her hand against his chest, she stepped back just enough to ensure a front-row view of the dimple sighting she knew was near. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because those extra goodies that were supposed to be for you were really, really, really delicious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Claire!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; She peeked back at her aunt. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me he didn&#x2019;t have that coming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did have that coming&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Jakob stepped around Claire, greeted Diane with a kiss on the cheek, and then claimed a spot on the porch swing. &#x201c;That said, you were kidding, right?&#x201d;</p><p>She joined him on the floral cushion. &#x201c;I was if you were.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Phew&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He rested his right arm along the back of the swing and found the perfect amount of sway with a practiced foot. &#x201c;So, Diane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Guess who called me last night to say he&#x2019;s back in town for a few days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Russ Granger.&#x201d;</p><p>A quick clap hijacked Claire&#x2019;s attention back to the wicker chair and the woman whose smile rivaled the late-September sun. &#x201c;Oh, Jakob, that&#x2019;s wonderful! I bet Callie and the children are positively thrilled!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Callie Davidson?&#x201d; At her aunt&#x2019;s nod, Claire moved on, tidbits of information she&#x2019;d managed to glean during her past eighteen-plus months in Heavenly falling into place a piece at a time. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the redhead that lives over by the playground, isn&#x2019;t it? The one with the three little towheads that couldn&#x2019;t be any cuter if they tried?&#x201d;</p><p>Diane nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. And Russ is her father. He retired down to Florida close to ten years ago after&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Serving as chief of the Heavenly Police Department,&#x201d; Claire finished as she turned her focus back on her swing mate. &#x201c;Oh, Jakob, no wonder you were smiling like that when you walked up! Your mentor is back in town!&#x201d;</p><p>He nuzzled his chin against the side of her head and then leaned back to look out over the same fields that had served as a backdrop for his Amish childhood. &#x201c;Trust me, Claire, that smile was all about you. Still, I&#x2019;m pretty excited to see Russ again, too. It&#x2019;s been a long time. He wanted me to come out and meet him at Murphy&#x2019;s on Route 65 when he called, but I was already in bed and I didn&#x2019;t want to take a chance of missing my alarm when it went off this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We could have rescheduled our picnic!&#x201d; Claire protested. &#x201c;Especially for something like seeing an old friend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know that. But I didn&#x2019;t want to reschedule.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you two keep in touch on the phone?&#x201d; Diane asked as she transferred the yarn from her lap to the small table at her elbow.</p><p>&#x201c;We try. And sometimes we go through spurts where we do pretty well with that. But more often than not, I&#x2019;m busy, he&#x2019;s busy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know how it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Hiking her calf onto the swing, Claire turned so her back was flush against the armrest and her view was of Jakob and her aunt. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Russ retired?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On paper, yes. But once a cop, always a cop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning?&#x201d; she prodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Russ has police work in his blood. Which means he got himself hired on at the station in his new town inside the first month of being down there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But not as a chief,&#x201d; Diane interjected.</p><p>Jakob nodded. &#x201c;Right. Not as a chief. According to him, he fiddles around at the front desk. Said it kept his finger on the pulse and him out of Amelia&#x2019;s hair.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I take it Amelia is his wife?&#x201d; At Diane&#x2019;s slow nod and downtrodden expression, Claire sighed. &#x201c;And I take it she&#x2019;s since passed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She did. About five years ago, I believe.&#x201d; At Diane&#x2019;s nod, Jakob continued. &#x201c;He retreated for a while after that. Didn&#x2019;t return my calls, didn&#x2019;t acknowledge the notes I sent, et cetera. But eventually he got his feet back under him and he&#x2019;d send me an occasional text to see how I was doing. When I told him I was considering coming back here if I could get a job, he pulled some strings and, well, here I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Remind me to thank him.&#x201d; Claire rested her cheek against his hand, watching him as he appeared to drift away in thought. After a few moments of silence, though, he caught her looking at him and smiled. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;When and where are you going to get to meet up with him again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tonight. At Heavenly Brews. Eight o&#x2019;clock. And I&#x2019;m kind of hoping you&#x2019;ll be with me when I do.&#x201d;</p><p>She drew back, surprised. &#x201c;But you haven&#x2019;t seen him in what? Two years, at least?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, it&#x2019;s been almost eight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you don&#x2019;t need me tagging along, Jakob,&#x201d; she protested. &#x201c;Go. Spend time with him. Talk cop stuff, tell him all the great things you&#x2019;ve done since you&#x2019;ve been here in Heavenly&#x2014;the cases you&#x2019;ve solved. You can introduce us a different day, before he heads back home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want him to meet you now, Claire. Besides, there&#x2019;s nothing Russ and I need to talk about that we can&#x2019;t talk about with you sitting at the table, too.&#x201d; Toeing the swing to a stop, he pushed his fingers through his sandy blond hair and laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, Russ is quite a character. He sees everything and forgets nothing. It&#x2019;s one of the reasons he made a heckuva cop and chief.&#x201d;</p><p>She waited for his hand to return to his lap and then captured it inside her own. &#x201c;So what you&#x2019;re telling me is he&#x2019;ll probably have some cute stories to share about you from your Rumspringa days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no doubt. Stories I&#x2019;ve long forgotten but he hasn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;m quite sure. Some that go back even before my Rumspringa, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Before? But how? You weren&#x2019;t able to hang around the station until you were on Rumspringa, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean I wasn&#x2019;t intrigued by men in uniform before that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And Russ being Russ noticed, of course. He made sure to wave whenever he caught me peeking out at him from the back of Dat&#x2019;s buggy on the way through town.&#x201d; Jakob turned his hand inside hers so they could intertwine their fingers and then nudged his chin toward the Amish countryside in the distance. &#x201c;Some of my fascination was simply because they looked different. I saw English from the back of Dat&#x2019;s buggy often, but police officers? Not so much. But it wasn&#x2019;t just about the uniforms and the shiny things hanging off them. It was the way they held themselves, the way they&#x2019;d get down to eye level with English children we&#x2019;d pass in town, and the way the English children looked back at them&#x2014;like they were something special, something to be respected.</p><p>I remember this time, when I was no more than six, maybe seven, and we were coming back from a horse auction or something. Dat was driving, of course, and I was sitting in the back of the buggy with Martha. We were heading down Lighted Way, which was nothing like it is today in terms of the number of stores. Anyway, this guy comes running out of a shop. And by running, I mean running. Anyway, a few seconds later, the shopkeeper comes out and starts yelling that this guy stole something from his store. Russ, who must have been sitting by an open window in the station house or something, comes running out, takes no more than a split second to get his bearings, and takes off after this guy. Before Dat&#x2019;s horse had all four feet on the gravelly part of the road just past what is now Yoder&#x2019;s Furniture, Russ had this guy on the ground with his hands behind his back.&#x201d; Jakob slid his gaze back to Claire&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t think I can ever explain just how taken I was with that&#x2014;how in awe I was of Russ and the entire police profession even though I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be in awe of anyone other than God.&#x201d;</p><p>Extricating her fingers from his, she scooted across the swing until they were practically nose to nose. &#x201c;You actually don&#x2019;t have to explain a thing, Jakob. It&#x2019;s written all over your face.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed and pulled her close. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait for you to meet him,&#x201d; he said against her temple. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to love him.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I could have imagined a better day than this, could you?&#x201d; Claire leaned back against Jakob&#x2019;s chest and watched as the rock he&#x2019;d been saving for last skipped across Miller&#x2019;s Pond four times before sinking below the surface. &#x201c;Summer is still here, but fall is most definitely knocking at the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fall has always been one of my very favorite times of the year.&#x201d; Jakob wrapped his rock-skipping arm around Claire and pressed his cheek against hers, his words serving as a tour of a life she could never seem to learn enough about. &#x201c;Sure, I loved coming here in the summer with Martha. Splashing around, skipping rocks, trying to swim to the other side&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was all good stuff. So, too, was winter and waiting for that moment when the ice was strong enough we could play hockey with whatever stick we could find.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you use as a puck?&#x201d; she asked as her mind&#x2019;s eye tried to place the man she knew with the boy he was describing.</p><p>&#x201c;Most of the time we used a flat rock, like the kind I was just skipping. A few times, we used one of my shoes. And once, we used a baseball hat we found on the side of the road.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mother didn&#x2019;t mind you taking off out of the house with an extra shoe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When we used a shoe, it was always one of the ones I was wearing.&#x201d;</p><p>She cocked her head up so she could see his face. &#x201c;But if the ice was hard enough to stand on, wasn&#x2019;t it too cold to be taking your shoes off?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amish boys at that age aren&#x2019;t much different than English boys. You see an opportunity to play, you play. No matter what.&#x201d;</p><p>Bringing her focus back to the water in front of them, she took in the sunlight dancing across the top, the squirrels chasing each other on the opposite shoreline, and the way the leaves on the nearby maple tree were beginning to hint at the autumn finery to come. Everywhere she looked, nature was at its best, but at that moment, thoughts of a young Amish Jakob, darting around the ice in one shoe, was all she could really see.</p><p>&#x201c;So who did you play hockey with? Martha?&#x201d;</p><p>His laugh rumbled against the back of her head. &#x201c;Oh no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Martha would hang with the best of us when it came time for summer activities. But when winter came, she stuck close to home, preferring to read or work on a quilt during any free time we happened to have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Isaac?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not Isaac, either. By the time he was old enough to get out on the ice without worrying he&#x2019;d do something silly, I was needed around the farm more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ben?&#x201d;</p><p>His chin nodded atop her head. &#x201c;Man, we had such fun when we were kids.&#x201d;</p><p>She knew he was still talking, even managed to register the part about Ben donating his shoe on occasion, too, but mostly she was just thinking about the Amish man she called friend. Benjamin Miller was quiet, kind, hardworking, a phenomenal listener, and a respected member among his brethren. The fact that he&#x2019;d actually proposed leaving his community to start a life with her the previous year had simply endeared him to her all the more. &#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;ll ever remarry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I hope so. Elizabeth has been gone a long time.&#x201d; He released his hold on her long enough to push a strand of her auburn hair off his cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen him in the fields with the Stutzman boys and he&#x2019;s good with them. He shows them how to do things instead of just telling them, you know? Makes me think he&#x2019;d make a good dad one day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The rest of her sentence fell away as the clip-clop of an approaching horse claimed their collective attention and sent it toward the dirt pathway they&#x2019;d navigated on foot not much more than two hours earlier. &#x201c;Sounds like we&#x2019;re about to get some company.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It does, indeed.&#x201d; Wiggling out from behind her, Jakob rose to his feet and then held out his hand to help her do the same. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, let&#x2019;s see who it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Together, they cleared the oak tree that had provided shade during their picnic, as well as back support for Jakob while they talked, and made their way toward the path. As they reached the edge, a familiar gray horse with a black mane and curly black tail stepped into their line of vision, pulling an equally familiar buggy.</p><p>Claire squealed. &#x201c;Ooooh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&#x2019;s Eli and Esther and the baby!&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, Ben&#x2019;s younger brother, Eli, lifted his hand in a wave as his wife and Claire&#x2019;s former gift shop employee turned friend, Esther, broke out in a mile-wide smile. In her arms, nestled in a simple blanket, was their two-week-old daughter, Sarah.</p><p>Claire waited until Eli stopped the buggy under a grove of trees and then ran around to Esther&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;Good afternoon, Esther! How is that precious little girl today?&#x201d;</p><p>The smile Claire couldn&#x2019;t imagine being any bigger, grew exponentially. &#x201c;She is good! She slept through her very first church service.&#x201d;</p><p>Esther exchanged a knowing smile with her husband, who, in turn, nodded like the proud new father he was. &#x201c;It was a good thing, too.

Their lives suddenly change with the arrival at their doorstep of a hulking, affable Canadian named Mike Flanagan, who declares himself the widower of Yaichi&#x2019;s estranged gay twin, Ryoji. Mike is on a quest to explore Ryoji&#x2019;s past, and the family reluctantly but dutifully takes him in. What follows is an unprecedented and heartbreaking look at the state of a largely still-closeted Japanese gay culture: how it&#x2019;s been affected by the West, and how the next generation can change the preconceptions about it and prejudices against it.<br><br><i>(Please note: This book is a traditional work of manga, and reads back to front and right to left.)</i></p><p><b>GENGOROH TAGAME</b> was born in 1964 and lives in Tokyo. After graduating from Tama University of Art, Tagame worked as an art director while writing manga and prose fiction, contributing illustrations for various magazines. In 1994 he cofounded the epochal <i>G-Men Magazine </i>and by 1996 he was working full-time as an openly gay artist. He is the author of dozens of graphic novels and stories which have been translated into English, French, Italian, and Korean. His artwork has been exhibited in galleries across Europe and America. <i>My Brother&#x2019;s Husband </i>marks his first all-ages title, and earned him a 2018 Eisner Award as well as the Japan Media Arts Award for Outstanding Work of Manga from the Agency of Cultural Affairs.&#x201c;When a cuddly Canadian comes to call, Yaichi&#x2014;a single Japanese dad&#x2014;is forced to confront his painful past.

There&#x2019;s something beautiful in the careful way that&nbsp;<i>My Brother&#x2019;s Husband </i>handles Yaichi&#x2019;s coming to terms with his feelings about his brother that&#x2019;s rarely seen in mainstream comics. Rather than treating the tension between Mike and Yaichi as a massively dramatic point on conflict, the book instead treats it like the complicated and messy holding pattern that it is . . . The message that Tagame&#x2019;s trying to get across&#x2014;that quiet, subtle bigotry can be just as harmful as loud, bombastic bigotry&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t always an easy one to process.

One of the most notable things about Tagame&#x2019;s artwork is just how vastly different it is from nearly anything I&#x2019;ve seen before. Not necessarily in terms of character designs, or settings, but in terms of the gaze itself. It&#x2019;s fascinating to see the male body portrayed through the gaze of a gay male creator . . .

Through the compelling stories of Black women who have<br>been most affected by racism, persistent poverty, class inequality, limited<br>access to support resources or institutions, Beth E. Richie shows that the<br>threat of violence to Black women has never been more serious, demonstrating how<br>conservative legal, social, political and economic policies have impacted<br>activism in the US-based movement to end violence against women. Richie argues<br>that Black women face particular peril because of the ways that race and<br>culture have not figured centrally enough in the analysis of the causes and<br>consequences of gender violence. As a result, the extent of physical, sexual<br>and other forms of violence in the lives of Black women, the various forms it<br>takes, and the contexts within which it occurs are minimized&#x2014;at best&#x2014;and<br>frequently ignored. </p><p>Arrested Justice<br>brings issues of sexuality, class, age, and criminalization into focus right<br>alongside of questions of public policy and gender violence, resulting in a<br>compelling critique, a passionate re-framing of stories, and a call to action<br>for change.</p></p><p><p><b>Beth E. Richie</b> is Director of the Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy, Professor of<br>African American Studies and Criminology, Law, and Justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women.</p>"This book provokes outrage and affords insight." (<i>American Studies</i>)<br><br>"Her new book, Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America's Prison Nation, is a critical examination and re-examination of several of the issues Richie has been writing about and working on for many years: prisons, the criminal legal/justice system, and the particular vulnerabilities of women and African-American women in particular as they operate at the intersection of what Richie and many other scholars point to as a profoundly racist and misogynistic system." (Yasmin Nair <i>Windy City Times</i>)<br><br>"A powerful and insightful call to action. Richie offers us a richly complex yet deeply usable analysis, rooted in a passionate commitment to producing knowledge that can change us and transform the world. Richie challenges us to ask ourselves what it would mean if we were to put the lives of the most stigmatized and the most violated at the center of our social justice work. The stories of injustice, survival and courage in these pages will stay with the reader long after turning the last page." (Julia C. Oparah,editor of Global Lockdown: Race, Gender and the Prison-Industrial Complex)<br><br>"By narrowing the scope of gender, violence, and crime more specifically to the U.S. case, she assesses both national and localized stories that reveal the fragility of black female lives in a nation driven by securing and maintaining prison profits...Even more profound, however, is the engagement Richie enforces with uncomfortable and long-avoided topics, including stalking, neighborhood assaults, incest, intimate partner abuse, rape, and even pervasive sexual harassment committed by the police in poor communities." (<i>WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"I hope all activists and scholarswomen of color and white women, young and oldread this book and from it, learn how stacked the system is against women of color, especially poor women." (<i>Women's Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Required reading for anyone interested in violence against women, black feminist theory, mass incarceration, or the welfare state. Essential for all levels/libraries." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"No one writes with passion like Beth Richie to convey the degree of danger the most marginalized women in our country are in. If there is one book you read to understand better why poor Black women are in continual dangerand several suggested ways of thinking about changing these conditions, then this is the book to read." (Natalie J. Sokoloff,editor of The Criminal Justice System and Women)<br><br>"Beth E. Richie...uses her expertise to reveal the hidden experience of black women living in marginalized communities. With over 25 years of work as a black feminist scholar and anti-violence activist, Richie tackles the extremely complicated interplay of race, gender and class that is causing violence against black women." (<i>Salon.com</i>)<br><br>"Richie expertly and chillingly documents the convergence of individual and structural racism, economic exploitation, and political disenfranchisement in the devastating gendered violence against the most disadvantaged Black women and girls.Arrested Justice represents the intersections of oppression at their most extreme. The book is frightening, enraging, and should be read by everyone." (Joanne Belknap,author of The Invisible Woman: Gender, Crime, and Justice)<br><br>"As a testament to the crumbling status of Black women in America, Richies book is a natural read for academic scholars in a variety of disciplines including Black studies, womens studies, sociology, and criminology.

I do not believe them, since I read the things myself, but I am willing to admit that there is probably some truth behind the myth--in other words, that you, who have read these few lines, are a member of a select minority. I do not quite see how I can repay you. You already know, I hope, that the book you hold is a collection of short stories. The jacket will have told you that I wrote them. (And, yes, I wrote them. My name really is Gene Wolfe, and I am an actual person.) The front matter has perhaps told you about my other books, and even where these stories originally appeared. All that remains for me is to tell you a little something concerning the stories themselves. To begin, they are largely what is called science fiction, though a good many are of that type of science fiction that is sometimes questioned, particularly by people who do not read much sf and therefore have a very definite idea of what it is and is not. Only "La Befana" and "Many Mansions" clearly take place off Earth. Several stories are not even futuristic. One at least is inarguably fantasy. Several are humorous, and I have been told often enough that I have a sense of humor that makes strong men faint and women reach for weapons; I should have known better than to include those, but now it is too late. I will not bore you with a description of how I came to write these stories. Neither will I presume to instruct you about writing stories in general--there is a whole library of books on how to do that already, though few of them seem to be much good. But I would like to leave you with a handful of words on how to read stories, these stories at least. I urge you not to read one after another, the way I eat potato chips. The simple act of closing this book and putting it away for another day will do a great deal for the story you have just read and even more for the next. If you are a purist, you might even go so far as to read each story on the designated day--"An Article About Hunting" at the opening of deer season, "The War Beneath the Tree" before Christmas. Even if you are not a purist, I urge you to think for a moment about the day, before beginning each story. Think on very young men in leggings and pie-pan helmets before you start "Against the Lafayette Escadrille." Think about somewhat older men who carry a lunchbucket (or a briefcase with a sandwich in it) before "Forlesen." Try to put aside your preconceptions. Don't be disappointed when you discover, as you will, that I am not Harlan Ellison or Isaac Asimov. Harlan and Isaac--as they would be the first to admit--are not me, either. Lastly, let me urge you to treat this and all books with respect. We will all benefit if you do. You cannot judge this book now. You will not even be able to judge it rightly when you have read its last story. Ten (or twenty) years from now you will know it was a good book if you remember any of the tales you are about to read. Meanwhile, its author begs you to preserve it as a physical object, so that at an appropriate time it can be shared by others. If you have bought it, those others may be friends you have not met or children you have thus far only dreamed of. If you have borrowed it from a library, they are your peers in the community, having the same rights in it as yourself. Let me tell you a story. &nbsp; <br> An acquaintance of mine who was a college student once discovered a secret door in the college library. It was a fire exit that was almost blocked by a huge bookcase full of fifty-year-old books in foreign languages--mostly Serbian, he said--and was unknown to the present staff. Outside, it was well screened by holly. Because there was no handle on the outside, he could not use it to enter the library; but he could, and did, use it to leave in company with whatever books he fancied. And he fancied three or four nearly every day. He lived in a small apartment he rented off-campus, and had no other home. As the semesters turned to years, this apartment grew crowded with stolen books. Books were piled on every table, in every corner, and even on his tiny dry bar. Books waited likeburglars under his bed. Waterproof books on swimming, boating, tropical fish, and similar subjects stood in a row along the edge of the tub; the toilet tank groaned and leaked under the crushing load of a hundred or so humorous books, so that even as he sat thinking how he might free himself from his thousands of stolen volumes, he feared they might fall and crush him. He considered simply returning the books to the library, but since they had never been checked out, they could hardly be returned, and it seemed to him that the head librarian--a woman with a singularly frigid gaze--suspected him already. He considered mailing them back anonymously, but the cost of postage would have been staggering. He considered setting fire to the building in which he lived, but he felt sure he would lose many valuable possessions now forgotten and buried under the books. Graduation loomed. At last he hit on a scheme that seemed foolproof. Instead of accepting a lucrative offer from a major corporation, he would have a rubber stamp made reading: DISCARDED BY THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. During the months immediately following graduation, he would stamp all the books in violet ink. In October, he would sell his car and jogging shoes, borrow all the money he could, and open a small used-book store. The thought of having a rack of birthday cards somewhere near the door cheered him. One fine day in May, as he was considering means of attracting shoplifters, he returned to his apartment and opened the door to see the sight he had most dreaded during all the grim years when he had been drowning in hoarded volumes. The head librarian sat waiting for him in his own chair (the only one clear of books) in his own living-dining-kitchenette. He would have fainted if he could, but he had never been quick. She had never been slow, and at this crucial moment she was icily calm. "I am sorry, sir," she said, "but this branch closes in five minutes." It was noon Saturday, and he became a homeless wanderer on the face of the earth until 9:30 Monday morning. &nbsp; <br> This has been the story for "Date Due." The people who do not read introductions missed it. LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY <i>How the Whip Came Back</i> Pretty Miss Bushnan's suite was all red acrylic and green-dyed leather. Real leather, very modern--red acrylic and green, real leather were the modern things this year. But it made her Louis XIV secretary, Sal, look terribly out of place. Miss Bushnan had disliked the suite from the day she moved in--though she could hardly complain, when there was a chance that the entire city of Geneva and the sovereign Swiss nation might be offended. This evening she did her best to like red and green, and in the meantime turned her eyes from them to the cool relief of the fountain. It was a copy of a Cellini salt dish and lovely, no matter how silly a fountain indoors on the hundred and twenty-fifth floor might be. In a characteristic reversal of feeling she found herself wondering what sort of place she might have gotten if she had had to find one for herself, without reservations, at the height of the tourist season. Three flights up in some dingy suburban pension, no doubt. So bless the generosity of the sovereign Swiss Republic. Bless the openhanded city of Geneva. Bless the hotel. And bless the United Nations Conference on Human Value, which brought glory to the Swiss Republic et cetera and inspired the free mountaineers to grant free hotel suites in the height of the season even to non-voting Conference observers such as she. Sal had brought her in a gibson a few minutes ago, and she picked it up from the edge of the fountain to sip, a little surprised to see that it was already three-quarters gone; <i>red and green.</i> A brawny, naked triton half-reclined, water streaming from his hair and beard, dripping from his mouth, dribbling from his ears. His eyes, expressionless and smooth as eggs, wept for her. Balancing herempty glass carefully on the rim again, she leaned forward and stroked his smooth, wet stone flesh. Smiling she told him--mentally--how handsome he was, and he blushed pink lemonade at the compliment. She thought of herself taking off her clothes and climbing in with him, the cool water soothing her face, which now felt hot and flushed. Not, she told herself suddenly, that she would feel any real desire for the triton in the unlikely event of his being metamorphosed to flesh. If she wanted men in her bed she could find ten any evening, and afterward edit the whole adventure from Sal's memory bank. She wanted a man, but she wanted only one, she wanted Brad (whose real name, as the terrible, bitter woman who lived in the back of her skull, the woman the gibson had not quite drowned, reminded her, had proved at his trial to be Aaron). The triton vanished and Brad was there instead, laughing and dripping Atlantic water on the sand as he threw up his arms to catch the towel she flung him. Brad running through the surf ... Sal interrupted her revery, rolling in on silent casters. "A gentleman to see you, Miss Bushnan." Sal had real metal drawer-pulls on her false drawers, and they jingled softly when she stopped to deliver her message, like costume jewelry. "Who?" Miss Bushnan straightened up, pushing a stray wisp of brown hair away from her face. Sal said blankly, "I don't know." The gibson had made Miss Bushnan feel pleasantly muzzy, but even so the blankness came through as slightly suspicious. "He didn't give you his name or a card?" "He did, Miss Bushnan, but I can't read it. Even though, as I'm sure you're already aware, Miss Bushnan, there's an Italian l...</p><h2>206 Bones: A Novel (12) (A Temperance Brennan Novel)</h2><p>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kathy Reichs delivers another &#x201c;outstanding&#x201d; book (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) in her &#x201c;cleverly plotted&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>) Temperance Brennan series, the inspiration for the hit FOX television series <i>Bones</i>.<br><br>There are 206 bones in the human body.

Suddenly, Tempe was accused of mishandling the autopsy&#x2014;and the case. Back in Montreal, the corpse of a second elderly woman was found in the woods, and then a third. Seamlessly weaving between Tempe&#x2019;s present-tense terror as she&#x2019;s held captive and her memory of the cases of these murdered women, Reichs reveals the incredible devastation that would occur if a forensic colleague sabotaged work in the lab. The chemistry between Tempe and Ryan intensifies as this complex, riveting tale unfolds, proving once again, that Reichs is the dominant talent in forensic mystery writing.</p><p>Kathy Reichs&#x2019;s first novel&nbsp;<i>D�j� Dead</i>&nbsp;was a #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller and won the 1997 Ellis Award for Best First Novel.&nbsp;<i>A Conspiracy of Bones</i>&nbsp;is Kathy&#x2019;s nineteenth entry in her series featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan.

Black as arctic winter.<br> <br>Am I dead?<br> <br>Obeying some limbic command, I inhaled deeply.<br> <br>Smells registered in my brain.<br> <br>Mold. Musty earth. Something organic, hinting at the passage of time.<br> <br>Was this hell? A tomb?<br> <br>I listened.<br> <br>Silence. Impenetrable.<br> <br>But no. There were sounds. Air moving through my nostrils. Blood pounding in my ears.<br> <br>Corpses don&#x2019;t breathe. Dead hearts don&#x2019;t beat.<br> <br>Other sensations intruded. Hardness below me. Burning on the right side of my face.<br> <br>I raised my head.<br> <br>Bitter bile flooded my mouth.<br> <br>I shifted my hips to relieve pressure on my twisted neck.<br> <br>Pain exploded up my left leg.<br> <br>A groan shattered the stillness.<br> <br>Instinctively, my body went fetal. The pounding gained volume.<br> <br>I lay curled, listening to the rhythm of my fear.<br> <br>Then, recognition. The sound had come from my own throat.<br> <br>I feel pain. I react. I am alive.<br> <br>But where?<br> <br>Spitting bile, I tried reaching out. Felt resistance. Realized my wrists were bound.<br> <br>I flexed a knee toward my chest, testing. My feet rose as one. My wrists dropped.<br> <br>I tried a second time, harder. Neurons again fired up my leg.<br> <br>Stifling another cry, I struggled to force order onto my addled thinking.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been bound, hands to feet, and abandoned. Where? When? By whom?<br> <br>Why?<br> <br>A memory search for recent events came up empty. No. The void in recollection was longer than that.<br> <br>I remembered picnicking with my daughter, Katy. But that was summer. The frigid temperature now suggested that it must be winter.<br> <br>Sadness. A last farewell to Andrew Ryan. That was October. Had I seen him again?<br> <br>A bright red sweater at Christmas. This Christmas? I had no idea.<br> <br>Disoriented, I groped for any detail from the past few days. Nothing stayed in focus.<br> <br>Vague impressions lacking rational form or sequence appeared and faded. A figure emerging from shadow. Man or woman? Anger. Shouting. About what? At whom?<br> <br>Melting snow. Light winking off glass. The dark maw of a cracked door.<br> <br>Dilated vessels pounded inside my skull. Hard as I tried, I could not evoke recollection from my semiconscious mind.<br> <br>Had I been drugged? Suffered a blow to the head?<br> <br>How bad was my leg? If I managed to free myself, could I walk? Crawl?<br> <br>My hands were numb, my fingers useless. I tried tugging my wrists outward. Felt no give in my bindings.<br> <br>Tears of frustration burned the backs of my lids.<br> <br>No crying!<br> <br>Clamping my jaw, I rolled to my back, raised my feet, and jerked my ankles apart. Flames roared up my left lower limb.<br> <br>Then I knew nothing.<br> <br>I awoke. Moments later? Hours? No way to tell. My mouth felt drier, my lips more parched. The pain in my leg had receded to a dull ache.<br> <br>Though I gave my pupils time, they took in nothing. How could they adjust? The dense blackness offered not a sliver of light.<br> <br>The same questions flooded back. Where? Why? Who?<br> <br>Clearly, I&#x2019;d been abducted. To be the victim in some sick game? To be removed as a threat?<br> <br>The thought triggered my first clear memory. An autopsy photo. A corpse, charred and twisted, jaws agape in a final agonal scream.<br> <br>Then a kaleidoscope sequence, image chasing image. Two morgues. Two autopsy rooms. Name plaques marking two labs. Temperance Brennan, Forensic Anthropologist. Temperance Brennan, Anthropologue Judiciaire.<br> <br>Was I in Charlotte? Montreal? Far too cold for North Carolina. Even in winter. Was it winter? Was I in Quebec?<br> <br>Had I been grabbed at home? On the street? In my car? Outside the �difice Wilfrid-Derome? Inside the lab?<br> <br>Was my captor a random predator and I a random victim? Had I been targeted because of who I am? Revenge sought by a former accused? By a conspiracy-theorist next of kin? What case had I last been working?<br> <br>Dear God, could it really be so cold? So dark? So still?<br> <br>Why that smell, so disturbingly familiar?<br> <br>As before, I tried wriggling my hands. My feet. To no avail. I was hog-tied, unable even to sit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Help! I&#x2019;m here! Someone! Help me!&#x201d;<br> <br>Over and over I called out until my throat grew raw.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyone! Please!&#x201d;<br> <br>My pleas went unanswered.<br> <br>Panic threatened to overwhelm me.<br> <br>You will not die helpless!<br> <br>Trembling from cold and fear, and frantic to see, I shifted to my back and started bucking my hips, stretching my hands upward as far as possible, oblivious to the agony in my leg. One thrust. Two. Three. My fingertips scraped hardness little more than a foot above my face.<br> <br>I lunged again. Made contact. Sediment cascaded into my eyes and mouth.<br> <br>Spitting and blinking, I rolled onto my right side and shoved backward with one arm and both feet. The rough ground abraded the skin on my elbow and heels. One ankle screamed in protest. I didn&#x2019;t care. I had to move. Had to get out.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d advanced a very short distance when I encountered a wall. Rectangular contours surrounded by mortar. Brick.<br> <br>Heart hammering, I rolled to my other side and inched in the opposite direction. Again, I soon hit a wall.<br> <br>Adrenaline flooded my body as terror piggybacked onto terror. My gut curdled. My lungs drew great heaving breaths.<br> <br>My prison was no more than thirty inches high and six feet wide! Its length didn&#x2019;t matter. Already I felt the walls pressing in.<br> <br>I lost control.<br> <br>Scooching forward, I began yelling and beating the brick with my fists. Tears streamed down my cheeks. Over and over I called out, hoping to attract the attention of a passerby. A worker. A dog. Anyone.<br> <br>When my knuckles grew raw I attacked with the heels of my hands.<br> <br>When I could no longer flail with my arms, I rolled and lashed out with my feet.<br> <br>Pain ripped from my ankle. Too much pain. My calls for help morphed into agonized moans.<br> <br>Defeated, I fell back, panting, sweat cooling on my icy flesh.<br> <br>A parade of faces marched through my mind. Katy. Ryan. My sister, Harry. My cat, Birdie. My ex-husband, Pete.<br> <br>Would I never see them again?<br> <br>Great heaving sobs racked my chest.<br> <br>Perhaps I lost consciousness. Perhaps not. My next awareness was of sound.<br> <br>A noise outside my body. Not of my making.<br> <br>I froze.<br> <br>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.<br> <br>A cerebral crack opened.<br> <br>Memory slipped through.<br><br>206 Bones 2<p></p> <br>ANOTHER WRISTWATCH CHECK. ANOTHER SIGH. MORE shifting feet.<br> <br>Above us, a wall clock ticked steadily, indifferent to Ryan&#x2019;s restlessness. It was the old-fashioned analog kind, round, with a sweep second hand that jumped in one-second increments with sharp little clicks.<br> <br>I surveyed my surroundings. Same plastic plant. Same bad print of a street scene in winter. Same half-empty mugs of tepid coffee. Phone. LCD projector. Screen. Laser pointer. Nothing new had magically appeared since I last looked.<br> <br>Back to the clock. A logo identified the manufacturer as Enterprise. Or perhaps that was a name for this particular model.<br> <br>Did people christen timepieces? Arnie Analog? Reggie Regulator?<br> <br>OK. I was as edgy as Ryan. And very, very bored.<br> <br>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.<br> <br>Old Enterprise said it was ten twenty-two. Oh-six. Oh-seven. Oh-eight. We&#x2019;d been waiting since nine o&#x2019;clock.<br> <br>Finger-drumming recommenced on the tabletop. Ryan had been performing off and on for thirty minutes. The staccato beat was getting on my nerves.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll meet with us as soon as he can,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Our coming here was his idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you lose a stiff in a morgue?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You heard Corcoran. They&#x2019;ve got over two hundred bodies. The facility is overstretched.&#x201d;<br> <br>While I have been described as impatient, Lieutenant-d�tective Andrew Ryan, Section des crimes contre la personne, S�ret� du Qu�bec, takes the term to a whole new plane. I knew the routine. Soon he&#x2019;d be pacing.<br> <br>Ryan and I were in a conference room at the Office of the Cook County Medical Examiner, on Chicago&#x2019;s West Side. We&#x2019;d flown from Montreal at the request of Christopher Corcoran, a staff pathologist with the CCME.<br> <br>More than three years earlier, a fifty-nine-year-old woman named Rose Jurmain had taken a trip from Chicago to Quebec to view the fall foliage. On the fourth day of her visit she&#x2019;d left her country inn for a walk and never returned. Her belongings remained behind in her room. No one saw or heard from her again.<br> <br>Thirty months later remains were discovered in a forested area half a mile north of the inn. Decomposition was advanced and animal damage was extensive. I&#x2019;d done the ID. Ryan had led the investigation. Now he and I were bringing Rose home.<br> <br>Why the personal service? For me, friendship with Corcoran and an excuse to visit the old hometown. For Ryan? A free trip to the Windy City.<br> <br>For Chris Corcoran and his boss? That would be one of my very first questions. Surely a CCME employee could have come to Montreal to collect the remains. Or a transport service. Until now the family had shown no interest in what was left of Rose Jurmain.<br> <br>And why the request for our presence in Chicago nine months after resolution of the case? The Bureau du coroner had ruled Rose&#x2019;s death an accident. Why the special interest now?<br> <br>Despite my curiosity, so far there&#x2019;d been no time for questions. Ryan and I had arrived to find media vans lining Harrison Street and the facility in lockdown.<br> <br>While parking us in the conference room, Corcoran had provided a quick explanation. The previous day, a funeral home had attempted to collect a body for cremation. Inexplicably, the corpse was nowhere to be found.<br> <br>All hands were engaged in crisis control. The chief was spinning for the press. A frantic search was under way. And Ryan and I were cooling our heels.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose the family is going ballistic,&#x201d; Ryan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oooh, yeah. And the media is loving it. Lost bodies. Shocked loved ones. Embarrassed politico. It&#x2019;s the stuff of Pulitzers.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a news junkie. At home I read, or at least skim, each day&#x2019;s paper from front to back. On the road, I tune in to CNN or a local station. Earlier, in my hotel room, I&#x2019;d flipped between WFLD and WGN. Though aware of the story, I&#x2019;d not anticipated the resulting chaos. Or the impact on us.<br> <br>Sure enough, Ryan got up and began pacing the room. I checked my pal Enterprise. Inspector Irritable was right on schedule.<br> <br>After logging roughly thirty yards, Ryan dropped back into his chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who was Cook?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was lost.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cook County?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No idea,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;How big is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The county?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My aunt Dora&#x2019;s fanny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have an aunt Dora?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Three.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stored that bit of familial trivia for future query.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cook is the second most populous county in the U.S., the nineteenth largest government in the nation.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d read those facts someplace.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the largest?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I look like an almanac?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Atlas.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some almanacs contain census data.&#x201d; Defensive. After the trip from Montreal, I was no longer in the mood for teasing.<br> <br>Though generally cheerful, Ryan is not a good traveler, even when the aviation gods are smiling. Yesterday they&#x2019;d been grumpy as hell.<br> <br>Instead of two hours, our flight from Pierre-Elliot Trudeau International to O&#x2019;Hare had taken six. First a weather delay. Then a mechanical complication. Then the crew went illegal for dancing naked on the tarmac. Or some such. Annoyed and frustrated, Ryan had passed the time nitpicking everything I said. His idea of jolly good banter.<br> <br>Several moments passed.<br> <br>Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.<br> <br>Ryan was pushing to his feet when the door opened and Christopher Corcoran entered, dressed in lab coat, jeans, and sneakers. With his pale skin, green eyes, red hair, and freckles, Corcoran was a walking Irish clich�. And decidedly nervous.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry for the delay. This missing body thing turned into an Italian opera.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate it when corpses go walkabout.&#x201d; The old Ryan wit.<br> <br>Corcoran gave a mirthless smile. &#x201c;Especially when the decedent&#x2019;s under your care.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was your case?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Corcoran nodded. As I looked at him, a million memories flooded my mind. A scrawny kid, all spindly limbs and wild carrot hair. Wrought-iron desks floor-bolted in long straight rows. Impromptu street games on hot summer nights. Interminable Masses on hard wooden pews.<br> <br>As kids, Corcoran and I were back-fence neighbors in a South Side neighborhood called Beverly, and card-carrying members at St. Margaret&#x2019;s of Scotland. Keep in mind that Chicago Catholics map people by parishes, not geography. An oddity, but there you have it.<br> <br>When I was eight, my father and baby brother died, and my family relocated to North Carolina. Corcoran stayed put. We lost touch, of course. I grew up, attended the University of Illinois, then graduate school at Northwestern. He studied at Michigan, undergrad through med school, then completed specialty training in pathology. It was forensics that brought us back into contact.<br> <br>Reconnection occurred in &#x2019;92 through a case involving a baby in a suitcase. By then Corcoran had married, returned to Chicago, and purchased a house on Longwood Drive. Though a little farther east and a lot upmarket, Corcoran had returned to the old spawning ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;Turns out it was here all along.&#x201d; Corcoran&#x2019;s voice brought me back. &#x201c;The guy was so scrawny he got hidden behind an obese woman on an upper gurney shelf. The techs just missed him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy ending,&#x201d; Ryan said.<br> <br>Corcoran snorted. &#x201c;Tell that to Walczak.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was said of Stanley Walczak that only his ego surpassed his ambition in raw tonnage. His cunning was fierce too. Upon the resignation of the previous ME nine months earlier, having forged a complex web of political connections, to the surprise of few, and the dismay of many, Walczak had called in his chits and been appointed Cook County Medical Examiner.<br> <br>&#x201c;Walczak is pissed?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The man detests bad publicity. And inefficiency.&#x201d; Corcoran sighed. &#x201c;We handle roughly twenty pickups a day here. Between yesterday and this morning the staff had to phone over sixty funeral homes to see if a delivery had been made to the wrong place. Four techs and three investigators had to be pulled off their normal duties to help check toe tags. It took three sweeps to finally locate the guy. Hell, we&#x2019;ve got half a cooler set aside just for long-term unknowns.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mistakes happen.&#x201d; I tried to sound encouraging.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here, misplacing a body is not considered a career-enhancing move.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fantastic pathologist. Walczak&#x2019;s lucky to have you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In his view, I should have been on top of the situation sooner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You expect fallout?&#x201d; Ryan asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The family&#x2019;s probably lawyer-shopping as we speak. Nothing like a few bucks to assuage unbearable anguish, even when there is no injury. It&#x2019;s the American way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Corcoran circled the table and we all sat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Walczak says he won&#x2019;t be long.

Larson delivers a masterful, overdue joint biography of our two most legendary Founding Fathers. As Larson relates, Franklin and Washington, though divided by a 26-year age gap and vastly different life experiences, underwent a similarly dramatic transformation from loyal British colonists to American nationalists, and found a shared purpose in their efforts to prepare the United States for independence.</p><p>Though the two men are acknowledged as towering figures of the Revolutionary Era, historians have tended to overlook the crucial importance of their unusual friendship. Larson makes a persuasive case that neither one could have succeeded without the other. During the Revolutionary War, Washington could not have thrived on the battlefield without the diplomacy that Franklin was conducting in France and Franklin could not have achieved his diplomatic coups without Washington&#x2019;s actions on the battlefield. For these efforts, Franklin has been hailed as America&#x2019;s greatest diplomat and Washington as its greatest general, yet each knowingly relied on the other. Beyond this, Franklin played a key role at the Second Continental Congress in securing and supporting Washington as the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. 12 years later, when Washington arrived in Philadelphia for the Constitutional Convention, he dined first with Franklin. Both men knew they needed the other to pull off the supreme act of unifying the states under a single Constitution.</p><p>In an enlightening and dramatic account of these two men&#x2019;s intertwined lives, Larson takes readers from the French and Indian War, through the Revolution and Constitutional Convention, and finally concluding with their final encounter when, near death, Franklin forced the issue of slavery before the new republic&#x2019;s first Congress. In this fascinating new window into the Revolutionary Era, Larson shines a new light on Franklin and Washington&#x2019;s heroic deeds and mutual purpose.</p><strong>Franklin &amp; Washington</strong> includes 10 illustrations &amp; photos.</p><p><p>EDWARD J.

A lifelong friendship and enormously productive collaboration was born, despite sharp differences in personality. The soft-spoken Wheeler, though conservative in appearance, was a raging nonconformist full of wild ideas about the universe. The boisterous Feynman was a cautious physicist who believed only what could be tested. Yet they were complementary spirits. Their collaboration led to a complete rethinking of the nature of time and reality. It enabled Feynman to show how quantum reality is a combination of alternative, contradictory possibilities, and inspired Wheeler to develop his landmark concept of wormholes, portals to the future and past. Together, Feynman and Wheeler made sure that quantum physics would never be the same again.<br></p><p><b>Paul Halpern</b> is a professor of physics at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, and the author of fifteen popular science books, most recently <i>Einstein's Dice and Schr�dinger's Cat</i>. He is also a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He lives near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."Excellent...[Halpern] brings onto the stage two of the key developers of the modern quantum theory."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Nature Physics</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Paul Halpern brings the full story of these men to life in a brilliant way...Feynman's contributions to the development of quantum field theory...are not only covered, they're explained in gloriously in-depth and simultaneously comprehensible fashion...Well-researched, well-written, and highly accessible."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Forbes</i>'s "Starts with a Bang!" blog</b></i></b><br><br>"Feynman was a doer, Wheeler a dreamer. So Paul Halpern aptly describes them in <i>The Quantum Labyrinth</i>, his book about their lives, work and friendship, and the virtues of their complementary styles...Feynman was one of the greatest intuitive problem-solvers in twentieth-century physics, a world-class doer.

The verses considered in it are generally agreed to be one of the sublimest portions of scripture. In it the Apostle brings his argument concerning assurance of salvation to a grand climax. The way in which he advances surely from argument to argument, piling one upon another, is astonishing, and constitutes the supreme example of inspired logic. In doing so he brings us face to face with the fundamental theme of the Bible - God&#39;s plan and purpose of redemption conceived before time and the foundation of the world, and spanning the whole of human history from the original creation to the final glory.</p><p>Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981) was born in Wales.

Baptist, a collection of the most relevant readings on the history of capitalism in America, created to accompany their EdX course "American Capitalism: A Reader." <br>To understand the past and especially our own times, arguably no story is as essential to get right as the history of capitalism. Nearly all of our theories about promoting progress come from how we interpret the economic changes of the last 500 years. This past decade's crises continue to remind us just how much capitalism changes, even as basic features like wage labor, financial markets, private property, and entrepreneurs endure. While capitalism has a global history, the United States plays a special role in that story. <br>"American Capitalism: A Reader" will help you to understand how the United States became the world's leading economic power, while revealing essential lessons about what has been and what will be possible in capitalism's ongoing revolution. Combining a wealth of essential readings, introductions by Professors Baptist and Hyman, and questions to help guide readers through the materials and broader subject, this course reader will prepare students to think critically about the history of capitalism in America.</p><p>American Capitalism The Wealth of Nations (1776)<p></p> <br><br> <br>ADAM SMITH<br> <br>The Wealth of Nations is the origin of Western economic thought. Every thinker since Smith has been forced to engage with his foundational ideas about division of labor, productive investment, and trade. In Smith we see the roots of both Marxism and mainstream economics. Smith&#x2019;s belief in manufacturing broke with Continental ideas which held that value could only come from cultivating land. Instead, he distinguishes laborers who add value to a commodity from other laborers, like &#x201c;menial servants,&#x201d; who do not. Another major insight is that productivity can be increased by either hiring more workers or providing workers with better machines. Both choices require more capital to be invested, but the possibilities for increasing the productivity of manufacturing are much greater than those for agriculture. In this way, Smith sees the future of wealth in nations that manufacture, not in ones that simply grow crops.<br> <br>BOOK I: Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of Labour, and of the Order According to which its produce is Naturally Distributed Among the Different Ranks of the People<br> <br>CHAPTER I: Of the Division of Labour<br> <br>The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than in others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.<br> <br>In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much greater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less observed.<br> <br>To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations.<br> <br>In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour.<br> <br>[&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;] It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the society.<br> <br>Compared, indeed, with the more extravagant luxury of the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear extremely simple and easy; and yet it may be true, perhaps, that the accommodation of an European prince does not always so much exceed that of an industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many an African king, the absolute masters of the lives and liberties of ten thousand naked savages. [&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;]<br> <br>CHAPTER II: Of the Principle which gives Occasion to the Division of Labour<br> <br>This division of labour, from which so many advantages are derived, is not originally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature, which has in view no such extensive utility; the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.<br> <br>Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human nature, of which no further account can be given, or whether, as seems more probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire.<br> <br>Two greyhounds, in running down the same hare, have sometimes the appearance of acting in some sort of concert. Each turns her towards his companion, or endeavours to intercept her when his companion turns her towards himself. This, however, is not the effect of any contract, but of the accidental concurrence of their passions in the same object at that particular time. Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog. Nobody ever saw one animal, by its gestures and natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am willing to give this for that. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.<br> <br>The difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much less than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came in to the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence, they were, perhaps, very much alike, and neither their parents nor play-fellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or soon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any resemblance. But without the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange, every man must have procured to himself every necessary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All must have had the same duties to perform, and the same work to do, and there could have been no such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great difference of talents.<br> <br>As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so remarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same disposition which renders that difference useful. Those different tribes of animals, however, though all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another. The strength of the mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of the greyhound, or by the sagacity of the spaniel, or by the docility of the shepherd&#x2019;s dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents, for want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be brought into a common stock, and do not in the least contribute to the better accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each animal is still obliged to support and defend itself, separately and independently, and derives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which nature has distinguished its fellows. Among men, on the contrary, the most dissimilar geniuses are of use to one another; the different produces of their respective talents, by the general disposition to truck, barter, and exchange, being brought, as it were, into a common stock, where every man may purchase whatever part of the produce of other men&#x2019;s talents he has occasion for.<br> <br>Book II: Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock<br> <br>Chapter III: Of the Accumulation of Capital, or of Productive and Unproductive Labour<br> <br>There is one sort of labour which adds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed: there is another which has no such effect. The former, as it produces a value, may be called productive; the latter, unproductive labour. Thus the labour of a manufacturer adds, generally, to the value of the materials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance, and of his master&#x2019;s profit. The labour of a menial servant, on the contrary, adds to the value of nothing.<br> <br>We are more industrious than our forefathers; because in the present times the funds destined for the maintenance of industry are much greater in proportion to those which are likely to be employed in the maintenance of idleness than they were two or three centuries ago. Our ancestors were idle for want of a sufficient encouragement to industry. It is better, says the proverb, to play for nothing than to work for nothing.<br> <br>The annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased in its value by no other means but by increasing either the number of its productive labourers, or the productive powers of those labourers who had before been employed. The number of its productive labourers, it is evident, can never be much increased, but in consequence of an increase of capital, or of the funds destined for maintaining them. The productive powers of the same number of labourers cannot be increased, but in consequence either of some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labour; or of a more proper division and distribution of employment. In either case an additional capital is almost always required. It is by means of an additional capital only that the undertaker of any work can either provide his workmen with better machinery or make a more proper distribution of employment among them.<br> <br>Questions<br> <br>1.&nbsp;Why is division of labor possible?<br> <br>2.&nbsp;What distinguishes a productive use of capital from an unproductive use of capital?<br> <br>3.&nbsp;Why can manufacturing expand more, in Smith&#x2019;s mind, than agriculture?<br> <br>4.&nbsp;Do you think you would enjoy pin making more or less if you were a pinmaker using division of labor? Would you enjoy your overall existence more or less?<br> <br>5.&nbsp;Smith points to trade as one of the key differences between humans and animals. How does he make his argument?<br> <br>6.&nbsp;Smith&#x2019;s account is largely about individual producers exchanging goods. Why do you think that his vision of the economy does not include firms? How might this story change with larger businesses?<br> <br>7.&nbsp;Does Smith believe that talent is innate or learned? What does this mean for division of labor? What does this mean about the justice of inequality?<br> <br>8.&nbsp;Selfishness is not usually thought of as a virtue, yet for Smith it results in virtuous outcomes. Does this imply that selfishness is not in fact unvirtuous?<br> <br>9.&nbsp;How does Smith justify the existence of peasants in a wealthy country?</p><h2>Dirty Korean: Everyday Slang (Dirty Everyday Slang)</h2><p><strong>GET D!RTY</strong><br><br>Next time you're traveling or just chattin' in Korean with your friends, drop the textbook formality and bust out with expressions they never teach you in school, including:<br><br> <strong>�Cool slang<br> �Funny insults<br> �Explicit sex terms<br> �Raw swear words</strong><br><br><em>Dirty Korean</em> teaches the casual expressions heard every day on the streets of Korea:<br><br><strong>�What's up? <em>Wasseo?</em><br><br>�Holy shit, I'm trashed. <em>Ssibal, na manchiwi.</em><br><br>�I gotta piss. <em>Na swi ssayahae.</em><br><br>�Who farted? <em>Bangu nuga ggyeosseo?</em><br><br>�Wanna try doggy-style? <em>Dwichigi haeboja?</em><br><br>�That bitch is crazy! <em>Heo nyeon michin nyeoniya!</em><br><br>�I could really go for some Korean BBQ. <em>Na cheolpangui meokgospieo.</em></strong> <br></p><p>Hyewon Geebi Baek was born and raised in Korea and attended the University of California Berkeley where she received a degree in art.

Michener details the reckless gamble U.S. voters make every four years: trusting the electoral college. In 1968, Michener served as a presidential elector in Pennsylvania. What he witnessed that fall disturbed him so much that he felt compelled to expose the very real potential in this system for a grave injustice with history-altering consequences. Incorporating the wide-ranging insight and universal compassion of Michener&#x2019;s bestselling novels, <i>Presidential Lottery </i>is essential reading for every American concerned about the ever-growing rift between the people and the political process.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Presidential Lottery</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Clear, concise, and sensible . . . a thoughtful book on how Americans choose their President.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An urgent appeal.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><p><b>James A. Michener</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s most popular writers, the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tales of the South Pacific, </i>the bestselling novels <i>The Source, Hawaii, Alaska, Chesapeake, Centennial, Texas, Caribbean, </i>and <i>Caravans, </i>and the memoir <i>The World Is My Home</i>. Michener served on the advisory council to NASA and the International Broadcast Board, which oversees the Voice of America. Among dozens of awards and honors, he received America&#x2019;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1977, and an award from the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities in 1983 for his commitment to art in America. Michener died in 1997 at the age of ninety.On election day 1968 the United States once again played a reckless game with its destiny. Acting as if we were immune to catastrophe, we conducted one more Presidential election in accordance with rules that are outmoded and inane. This time we were lucky. Next time we might not be. Next time we could wreck our country.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dangerous game we play is this. We preserve a system of electing a President which contains so many built-in pitfalls that sooner or later it is bound to destroy us. The system has three major weaknesses. It places the legal responsibility for choosing a President in the hands of an Electoral College, whose members no one knows and who are not bound to vote the way their state votes. If the Electoral College does not produce a majority vote for some candidate, the election is thrown into the House of Representatives, where anything can happen. And it is quite possible that the man who wins the largest popular vote across the nation will not be chosen President, with all the turmoil that this might cause.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1823 Thomas Jefferson, who as we shall see had long and painful experience with this incredible system, described it as, &#x201c;The most dangerous blot on our Constitution, and one which some unlucky chance will some day hit.&#x201d; Today the danger is more grave than when Jefferson put his finger on it.<br> &nbsp;<br> To understand how ridiculous our system is I invite you to follow my adventures last autumn and to see for yourself how close our nation came to turmoil, if not actual disaster.<br> &nbsp;<br> In late August my phone rang and a voice I knew well and favorably asked, &#x201c;Michener, you want to be a Presidential elector?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Milt Berkes, Democratic chairman for my home county, representative in the Pennsylvania lower house, and the hardest-working politician I know. When I ran for Congress, Milt was my campaign manager, and later when I was required to introduce him at public meetings I said, &#x201c;Milt used my money to learn about politics. He used his own to get elected.&#x201d; Our friendship had gone beyond politics, for I liked this former Philadelphia schoolteacher who had moved out to the suburbs to make a good life for his family.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, how about it?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the moment I was sick in spirit over the debacle at Chicago and wanted no involvement with politics, but as a historian and as one who had worked hard in the practical politics of Pennsylvania, I sensed that the 1968 election was going to be of special significance. I therefore agreed to serve, even though I knew that I was heading for a potential confrontation of grave consequence.<br> &nbsp;<br> I make this statement carefully and conscientiously: When I accepted the nomination I already knew what might happen in the fall election and I was aware of the part I could be forced to play if Pennsylvania went Democratic and thrust me into the Electoral College. Nevertheless I replied, &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> All across America similar phone calls were being made. &#x201c;Hey, Joe! You wanna be an elector?&#x201d; &#x201c;Sure, why not?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was as simple as that. Men and women were being chosen for one of the potentially most complex responsibilities in our political life simply because they had contributed money to the party, or had been loyal ward leaders, or were known as reliable party hacks.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you look in Appendix A, at Article II of the United States Constitution, Section 1, paragraph 2, you will see that it says: &#x201c;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There are three steps in the process of becoming a duly elected elector&#x2014;nomination; pledge to vote the way the state has voted; November election&#x2014;and the fifty state legislatures have come up with a variety of alternatives for each.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nomination. If one took into account the various refinements in this process he would end with a group of startling variations, but they would tend to cluster around certain agreed-upon procedures. In many states conventions of the party nominate (e.g., California, Ohio). In other states the state committee chooses (Georgia, New York). In one the electors are nominated by a small executive committee (District of Columbia). Some states do not nominate but choose by state primary (Arizona, Alabama). In one state electors may be chosen &#x201c;in any manner prescribed by the by-laws of the party&#x201d; (Alaska). In another the governor of the state nominates, on recommendation of the political parties (Florida). In one a variety of alternatives is offered (Kentucky). In one each party may nominate two groups, one pledged, the other unpledged, and these compete in a primary (Mississippi). And in my state, Pennsylvania, the Presidential candidates chosen by the national conventions are required to name the specific electors they want to vote for them in the Electoral College if their party carries the state in November.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pledge to vote the way the state has voted. Here again the practices vary. Some states require pledges; others do not. Some claim that a pledge has been presumed when a man offers his name in the primary of his party; others require a signed document. One official summary of the variations concludes, &#x201c;In Pennsylvania, where electors are nominated by the Presidential nominee, it seems apparent that such electors must have pledged their loyalty to such Presidential nominee or he would not have selected them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Actual election. In this area there are fewer variations. Most states do not list the names of the electors of each party on the ballot but agree that a vote for the President and Vice-President will be automatically interpreted to mean one vote for each of the allotted electors (e.g., Colorado, Wisconsin). Other states print the names of the electors on their ballots (Idaho, North Dakota). In two states ballots are provided with lists of pledged and unpledged would-be electors (Alabama, Mississippi). And in one the individual parties are given discretionary choice as to whether they want the names of their electors on the ballot (South Carolina).<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to the above variations in procedure, the individual states also give their electors special instructions, whose terms vary enormously, but Oklahoma&#x2019;s is unique: &#x201c;Any person elected as Presidential elector...after taking and filing the oath or affirmation prescribed...who violates said oath or affirmation by either failing to cast his ballot [for his party&#x2019;s candidates for President and Vice-President] or by casting his ballot for any other person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.&#x201d; Because this question will become important later, it should be explained now that whereas Oklahoma could quite properly fine any errant elector up to $1,000, it could not compel him to vote right in the first place, nor could the wrong vote, once cast, be corrected. States may cajole (Massachusetts) or exhort (Nevada) or threaten (New Mexico) or fine (Oklahoma) but they cannot force the elector to vote in any way other than in accordance with the dictates of his conscience&#x2014;or the terms of whatever deal he may have arranged. Once he is officially and legally elected to his position, he can do what he likes, and no one can stop him in advance, even though he might be punished later. Specifically, there is no provision for a writ of mandamus, and if one were issued, it could not be enforced.<br> &nbsp;<br> The qualified elector, therefore, is free to vote precisely as he wishes, which was the original intent of the Constitution and which is its intent now. Look at the experience in recent years.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1948 Preston Parks of Tennessee happened to be nominated as an elector on two different slates, one for Truman, the other for Thurmond. Truman carried the state, but Parks decided that he preferred Thurmond and voted for him. Tennessee was powerless to prevent him from doing so, for he was a legally elected Presidential elector and could do as he pleased.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1956 W. F. Turner of Alabama was elected to vote for Adlai Stevenson, but when the time came to vote he cast his ballot for a local judge, Walter E. Jones. In explanation Turner said, &#x201c;I have fulfilled my obligation to the people of Alabama. I&#x2019;m talking about the white people.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oklahoma&#x2019;s law punishing such behavior came about in this way: In 1960 Henry D. Irwin, pledged to Nixon, decided to strike out on his own and cast his ballot for Senator Harry Byrd. This caused a storm of protest, but Irwin explained that in his opinion the Founding Fathers of our nation were landowners and propertied people who never intended that &#x201c;the indigent, the non-property owners should have a vote in such a momentous decision&#x201d; as the election of a President. Shortly thereafter Oklahoma established the requirement that a nominee elector must subscribe to a statutory oath that if elected he will cast his ballot for his party&#x2019;s candidate, or be liable to the $1,000 fine.</p><h2>Racism in the Nation&#39;s Service: Government Workers and the Color Line in Woodrow Wilson&#39;s America</h2><p>Between the 1880s and 1910s, thousands of African Americans passed civil service exams and became employed in the executive offices of the federal government. However, by 1920, promotions to well-paying federal jobs had nearly vanished for black workers. Eric S. Yellin argues that the Wilson administration's successful 1913 drive to segregate the federal government was a pivotal episode in the age of progressive politics. Yellin investigates how the enactment of this policy, based on Progressives' demands for whiteness in government, imposed a color line on American opportunity and implicated Washington in the economic limitation of African Americans for decades to come.<br>Using vivid accounts of the struggles and protests of African American government employees, Yellin reveals the racism at the heart of the era's reform politics. He illuminates the nineteenth-century world of black professional labor and social mobility in Washington, D.C., and uncovers the Wilson administration's progressive justifications for unraveling that world. From the hopeful days following emancipation to the white-supremacist "normalcy" of the 1920s, Yellin traces the competing political ideas, politicians, and ordinary government workers who created "federal segregation."<br><br></p><p>Eric S. Yellin is associate professor of history and American studies at the University of Richmond.This is a highly readable and compelling narrative based on extraordinary research. Yellin fills in a crucial gap in the history of sanctioned segregation and its effect between <i>Plessy</i> and <i>Brown</i> and illuminates a crucial shift in the way institutional racism worked and was largely accepted, despite extensive efforts to prevent it from taking hold.

Now, in the spring of 1941, they arrive in Egypt as Rommel&#x2019;s forces slowly but surely approach Cairo across the Sahara from the west. Will the city fall? In the streets the people contemplate welcoming a new set of occupiers, while European refugees and well-heeled Anglo-Egyptians prepare to pack their bags. And at night, everyone who is anyone flocks to the city&#x2019;s famed hotels and seedy cabarets, seeking one last dance before the tanks roll in. <br><br>Manning describes the Pringles&#x2019; ever complicated marriage and their motley group of friends and foes with the same sharp eye that earned <i>The Balkan Trilogy</i> a devoted following. And she also traces the fortunes of a marvelously drawn new character, Simon Boulderstone, a twenty-year-old recruit who must grapple with the boredom, chaos, and fleeting exhilaration of war.</p><p><b>Olivia Manning</b> (1908&#x2013;1980) was born in Portsmouth, England, and spent much of her childhood in Northern Ireland. Her father, Oliver, was a penniless British sailor who rose to become a naval commander, and her mother, Olivia, had a prosperous Anglo-Irish background. Manning trained as a painter at the Portsmouth School of Art, then moved to London and turned to writing. She published her first novel under her own name in 1938 (she had published several potboilers in a local paper under the name Jacob Morrow while a teenager). The next year she married R.D. &#x201c;Reggie&#x201d; Smith, and the couple moved to Romania, where Smith was employed by the British Council. During World War II , the couple fled before the Nazi advance, first to Greece, then to Egypt, and finally to Jerusalem, where they lived until the end of the war. Manning wrote several novels during the 1950s, but her first real success as a novelist was <i>The Great Fortune</i> (1960), the first of six books concerning Guy and Harriet Pringle, whose wartime experiences and troubled marriage echoed that of the diffident Manning and her gregarious husband. In the 1980s these novels were collected in two volumes, <i>The Balkan Trilogy</i> and <i>The Levant Trilogy</i>, known collectively as <i>Fortunes of War</i>. In addition to her novels, Manning wrote essays and criticism, history, a screenplay, and a book about Burmese and Siamese cats. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976, and died four years later.<br><br><b>Anthony Sattin</b> is a journalist, broadcaster, and former resident of Cairo.

Who belongs to me? To whom do I belong? These are timeless questions that guide the church to its fundamental calling. Today terms like neighbor, family, and congregation are being redefined. People are searching to belong in new places and experiences. The church needs to adapt its interpretations, definitions, and language to make sense in the changing culture. This book equips congregations and church leaders with tools to: � Discern the key ingredients people look for in community � Understand the use of space as a key element for experiencing belonging and community � Develop the &#x201c;chemical compound&#x201d; that produces an environment for community to spontaneously emerge � Discover how language promotes specific spatial belonging and then use this knowledge to build an effective vocabulary for community development � Create an assessment tool for evaluating organizational and personal community health</p></p><p>Joseph R.

He is a founding partner of a communication arts group, SETTINGPACE, and owns a consulting firm, FrontPorch, which specializes in creating conversations that promote and develop community.the myths of belonging Our old ideas about space have exploded.The past three decades have produced more change in more cultures than any other time in history. Radically accelerated growth, deregulation, and globalization have redrawn our familiar maps and reset the parameters: Borders are inscribed and permeated, control zones imposed and violated, jurisdictions declared and ignored, markets pumped up and punctured.And at the same time, entirely new spatial conditions, demanding new definitions, have emerged.Where space was considered permanent, it now feels transitory---on its way to becoming.The words and ideas of architecture, once the official language of space, no longer seem capable of describing this proliferation of new conditions. But even as its utility is questioned in the real world, architectural language survives, its repertoire of concepts and metaphors resurrected to create clarity and definition in new, unfamiliar domains (think chat rooms,Web sites, and firewalls).Words that die in the real are reborn in the virtual.1 Rem Koolhaas, in a guest editorial for a special issue of Wired Wen our pastor rose to make the announcement, I suspected we were in for it again. &#39;We&#39;re going to be a church of small groups,&#39; he told us, like a child pleading for his parents to read from the well-worn book one more time. &#39;A church of small groups instead of a church with small groups.&#39; My heart sank. Been there; done that. I remembered attending a small group several years earlier. It was the next step in my process of growing deeper in Christ and in community. &#39;Everyone in a small group&#39; was the church-wide goal. So my wife, Sara, and I hopped in our car and began our eight-week commitment. We were greeted kindly at the door. It was not so much a friendship sort of kind as it was a salesman&#39;s type. &#39;This is the first time,&#39; I told myself, &#39;so relax and enjoy.&#39; Once gathered in the &#39;family&#39; room, we played several silly, juvenile games in the hope of opening the door to relational bliss. Next, we were asked to agree to and sign a Group Covenant. The covenant seemed harmless enough. It established a purpose for the group. It enlisted everyone to the 100 percent attendance policy. It explained a code of group life. It requested that we enter into accountable relationships with our new &#39;friends.&#39; The covenant was very organizational and institutional. Its purpose, values, and vision were all clearly stated. Everyone signed on the line. Our well-trained leader promised that eight weeks later we would all arrive at a closer walk with God and with one another. Sounded promising and hopeful, so we started. By the third week I had had enough. I did not want to return to share my deepest thoughts. I did not want to give obvious answers to predictable questions from the published small group material. I did not want to play one more icebreaker game. I was not getting closer to anyone. Instead, I was getting angry. This group was expecting more from me than I wanted to deliver. And this group was trying to deliver to me more than I wanted. A church of small groups? Sounded like forced relational hell to me. Others tell of similar experiences.When a friend asked Miguel to help start a men&#39;s small group for the new year, he agreed at once.Through a contact in the hotel business, Miguel found the ideal meeting place and time: Holiday Inn at 6:30 a.m. on the second and fourth Tuesdays.The men would meet for breakfast, pray, read from a study book, and by 7:30 be on their separate ways to work. The group was launched and continued through the spring, summer, fall, and even the winter. Sometimes as few as four gathered, sometimes as many as seven. Every second and fourth Tuesday at 6:30 a.m., often on cold and dark mornings, they met. Through vacations, travel schedules, traffic tie-ups, the group met. As the second summer approached, someone suggested, &#39;Let&#39;s take a breather for a few months.&#39; Everybody agreed.When September arrived, not one person suggested starting again. Common Myths of Belonging Community is a complex creature. Many factors contribute to finding successful community.With the erosion of the geographically close family and the heightened mobility of our culture, many people struggle to learn healthy competencies for community. Schools, service agencies, churches, and other organizations are making a concerted effort to help.Yet several common myths surround the search to belong, myths that dilute and confuse the definitions we employ to describe our journey to connect. More time = more belonging. The first myth is that the greater the amount of time spent in relationship with another person, the more authentic the community will be.This is a pervasive myth. In reality, time has little to do with a person&#39;s ability to experience significant belonging. Many people tell stories of first-time, episodic introductions from which a spontaneous connection emerges. Have you ever said, &#39;I just met you, but it seems like I&#39;ve known you all my life.&#39; Contrast this with Teri&#39;s feelings about Maggie.The two roomed together in college years ago, and ever since have exchanged Christmas cards and the occasional letter. Last summer Maggie invited herself to spend a few days with Teri. When Teri got the phone call, she immediately went to her pastor. &#39;I didn&#39;t like her then,&#39; she groaned. &#39;I put up with her. Her side of the room was always filthy. She&#39;s domineering. I don&#39;t want her to come here.What do I do? We roomed together for four years, but we were never really friends.&#39; Or, for still another perspective, Rose describes an experience at her church: About a month ago a woman named Sandra began attending. She is 56 years old. She came to our group last night. She has zero church background. Four years ago she was alone on a week-long vacation to Mexico. One morning by the pool, she struck up a conversation with the young woman sitting next to her. She learned that this young woman was there on her honeymoon. When the bride&#39;s husband joined her by the pool, Sandra tried to excuse herself, but they just kept talking with her. Sandra said that off and on during the rest of her vacation, she ran into this couple.They mentioned they attended a Vineyard church in California. Sandra was quick to mention to me, &#39;It wasn&#39;t like they were trying to recruit me or anything; it just came up in one of our conversations that they were Christians and where they went to church.&#39; Sandra was so impressed with how kind they were, and she liked how they treated each other. She went away from them thinking they had something---values or a lifestyle---she found attractive. She told me probably once a year for the past four years she has thought about going to church. She looked in the phonebook for a Vineyard church (because she had no idea where else to go) and found us. A short connection around a swimming pool had significance years later. Belonging is not controlled by time, and time by itself does not develop belonging.</p><h2>The Chocolate Maker&#39;s Wife: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Australian bestselling novelist Karen Brooks rewrites women back into history with this breathtaking novel set in 17th century London&#x2014;a lush, fascinating story of the beautiful woman who is drawn into a world of riches, power, intrigue...and chocolate.</strong></p><p><em>Damnation has never been so sweet...</em></p><p>Rosamund Tomkins, the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman, spends most of her young life in drudgery at a country inn.

Years before, he had been an English major at Baltimore's Loyola College and had always dreamed of writing a novel. His first effort, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>--the first of the phenomenally successful Jack Ryan novels--sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list after President Reagan pronounced it "the perfect yarn." From that day forward, Clancy established himself as an undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He passed away in October 2013.CHAPTER 1<br><br><i>A Sunny Day in Londontown</i><br>Ryan was nearly killed twice in half an hour. He left the taxi a few blocks short of his destination. It was a fine, clear day, the sun already low in the blue sky. Ryan had been sitting for hours in a series of straight-back wooden chairs, and he wanted to walk a bit to work the kinks out. Traffic was relatively light on the streets and sidewalks. That surprised him, but he looked forward to the evening rush hour. Clearly these streets had not been laid out with automobiles in mind, and he was sure that the afternoon chaos would be something to behold. Jack's first impression of London was that it would be a fine town to walk in, and he moved at his usual brisk pace, unchanged since his stint in the Marine Corps, marking time unconsciously by tapping the edge of his clipboard against his leg.<br><br>Just short of the corner the traffic disappeared, and he moved to cross the street early. He automatically looked left, right, then left again as he had since childhood, and stepped off the curb --<br><br>And was nearly crushed by a two-story red bus that screeched past him with a bare two feet to spare.<br><br>"Excuse me, sir." Ryan turned to see a police officer -- they called them constables over here, he reminded himself -- in uniform complete to the Mack Sennett hat. "Please do be careful and cross at the corners. You might also mind the painted signs on the pavement to look right or left. We try not to lose too many tourists to the traffic."<br><br>"How do you know I'm a tourist?" He would now, from Ryan's accent.<br><br>The cop smiled patiently. "Because you looked the wrong way, sir, and you dress like an American. Please be careful, sir. Good day." The bobby moved off with a friendly nod, leaving Ryan to wonder what there was about his brand-new three-piece suit that marked him as an American.<br><br>Chastened, he walked to the corner. Painted lettering on the blacktop warned him to look right, along with an arrow for the dyslexic. He waited for the light to change, and was careful to stay within the painted lines. Jack remembered that he'd have to pay close attention to the traffic, especially when he rented the car Friday. England was one of the last places in the world where the people drove on the wrong side of the road. He was sure it would take some getting used to.<br><br>But they did everything else well enough, he thought comfortably, already drawing universal observations one day into his first trip to Britain. Ryan was a practiced observer, and one can draw many conclusions from a few glances. He was walking in a business and professional district. The other people on the sidewalk were better dressed than their American counterparts would be -- aside from the punkers with their spiked orange and purple hair, he thought. The architecture here was a hodgepodge ranging from Octavian Augustus to Mies van der Rohe, but most of the buildings had an old, comfortable look that in Washington or Baltimore would long since have been replaced with an unbroken row of new and soulless glass boxes. Both aspects of the town dovetailed nicely with the good manners he'd encountered so far. It was a working vacation for Ryan, but first impressions told him that it would be a very pleasant one nonetheless.<br><br>There were a few jarring notes. Many people seemed to be carrying umbrellas. Ryan had been careful to check the day's weather forecast before setting out on his research trip. A fair day had been accurately predicted -- in fact it had been called a hot day, though temperatures were only in the upper sixties. A warm day for this time of year, to be sure, but "hot"? Jack wondered if they called it Indian summer here. Probably not. Why the umbrellas, though? Didn't people trust the local weather service? Was <i>that</i> how the cop knew I was an American?<br><br>Another thing he ought to have anticipated was the plethora of Rolls-Royces on the streets. He hadn't seen more than a handful in his entire life, and while the streets were not exactly crowded with them, there were quite a few. He himself usually drove around in a five-year-old VW Rabbit. Ryan stopped at a newsstand to purchase a copy of <i>The Economist</i>, and had to fumble with the change from his cab fare for several seconds in order to pay the patient dealer, who doubtless also had him pegged for a Yank. He paged through the magazine instead of watching where he was going as he went down the street, and presently found himself halfway down the wrong block. Ryan stopped dead and thought back to the city map he'd inspected before leaving the hotel. One thing Jack could not do was remember streets names, but he had a photographic memory for maps. He walked to the end of the block, turned left, proceeded two blocks, then right, and sure enough there was St. James's Park. Ryan checked his watch; he was fifteen minutes early. It was downhill past the monument to a Duke of York, and he crossed the street near a longish classical building of white marble.<br><br>Yet another pleasant thing about London was the profusion of green spaces. The park looked big enough, and he could see that the grass was tended with care. The whole autumn must have been unseasonably warm. The trees still bore plenty of leaves. Not many people around, though. Well, he shrugged, it's Wednesday. Middle of the week, the kids were all in school, and it was a normal business day. So much the better, he thought. He'd deliberately come over after the tourist season. Ryan did not like crowds. The Marine Corps had taught him that, too.<br><br>"<i>Daddee</i>!" Ryan's head snapped around to see his little daughter running toward him from behind a tree, heedless as usual of her safety. Sally arrived with her customary thump against her tall father. Also as usual, Cathy Ryan trailed behind, never quite able to keep up with their little white tornado. Jack's wife did look like a tourist. Her Canon 35mm camera was draped over one shoulder, along with the camera case that doubled as an oversized purse when they were on vacation.<br><br>"How'd it go, Jack?"<br><br>Ryan kissed his wife. Maybe the Brits don't do that in public either, he thought. "Great, babe. They treated me like I owned the place. Got all my notes tucked away." He tapped his clipboard. "Didn't you get anything?" Cathy laughed.<br><br>"The shops here deliver." She smiled in a way that told him she'd parted with a fairish bit of the money they had allocated for shopping. "And we got something really nice for Sally."<br><br>"Oh?" Jack bent over to look his daughter in the eye. "And what might that be?"<br><br>"It's a surprise, Daddy." The little girl twisted and giggled like a true four-year-old. She pointed to the park. "Daddy, they got a lake with swans and peccalins!"<br><br>"Pelicans," Jack corrected.<br><br>"Big white ones!" Sally loved peccalins.<br><br>"Uh-huh," Ryan observed. He looked up to his wife. "Get any good pictures?"<br><br>Cathy patted her camera. "Oh, sure. London is already Canonized -- or would you prefer that we spent the whole day shopping?" Photography was Cathy Ryan's only hobby, and she was good at it.<br><br>"Ha!" Ryan looked down the street. The pavement here was reddish, not black, and the road was lined with what looked like beech trees. The Mall, wasn't it? He couldn't remember, and would not ask his wife, who'd been to London many times. The Palace was larger than he'd expected, but it seemed a dour building, three hundred yards away, hidden behind a marble monument of some sort. Traffic was a little thicker here, but moved briskly. "What do we do for dinner?"<br><br>"Catch a cab back to the hotel?" She looked at her watch. "Or we can walk."<br><br>"They're supposed to have a good dining room. Still early, though. These civilized places make you wait until eight or nine." He saw another Rolls go by in the direction of the Palace. He was looking forward to dinner, though not really to having Sally there. Four-year-olds and four-star restaurants didn't go well together. Brakes squealed off to his left. He wondered if the hotel had a baby-sitting --<br><br><b>BOOM!<br><br></b>Ryan jumped at the sound of an explosion not thirty yards away. <i>Grenade</i>, something in his mind reported. he sensed the whispering sound of fragments in the air and moments later heard the chatter of automatic weapons fire. He spun around to see the Rolls turned crooked in the street. The front end seemed lower than it should be, and its path was blocked by a black sedan. There was a man standing at its right front fender, firing an AK-47 rifle into the front end, and another man was racing around to the car's left rear.<br><br>"<i>Get down</i>!" Ryan grabbed his daughter's shoulder and forced her to the ground behind a tree, yanking his wife roughly down beside her. A dozen cars were stopped raggedly behind the Rolls, none closer than fifty feet, and they shielded his family from the line of fire. Traffic on the far side was blocked by the sedan. The man with the Kalashnikov was spraying the Rolls for all he was worth.<br><br>"Sonuvabitch!" Ryan kept his head up, scarcely able to believe what he saw. "It's the goddamned IRA -- they're killing somebody right -- " Ryan moved slightly to his left. His peripheral vision took in the faces of people up and down the street, turning and staring, in each face the black circle of a shock-opened mouth. <i>This is really happening!</i> he thought, <i>right in front of me, just like that, just like some Chicago gangster movie. Two bastards are committing murder. Right here. Right now. Just like that</i>. "Son of a bitch!"<br><br>Ryan moved farther left, screened by a stopped car. Covered by its front fender, he could see one man standing at the left rear of the Rolls, just standing there, his pistol hand extended as though expecting someone to bolt from the passenger door. The bulk of the Rolls screened Ryan from the AK gunner, who was crouched down to control his weapon. The near gunman had his back to Ryan. He was no more than fifty feet away. He didn't move, concentrating on the passenger door. His back was still turned. Ryan would never remember making any conscious decision.<br><br>He moved quickly around the stopped car, head down, keeping low and accelerating rapidly, his eyes locked on his target -- the small of the man's back -- just as he'd been taught in high school football. It took only a few seconds to cover the distance, with Ryan's mind reaching out, willing the man to stay dumb just a moment longer. At five feet Ryan lowered his shoulder and drove off both legs. His coach would have been proud.<br><br>The blind-side tackle caught the gunman perfectly. His back bent like a bow and Ryan heard bones snap as his victim pitched forward and down. A satisfying <i>klonk</i> told him that the man's head had bounced off the bumper on the way to the pavement. Ryan got up instantly -- winded but full of adrenaline -- and crouched beside the body. The man's pistol had dropped from his hand and lay beside the body. Ryan grabbed it. It was an automatic of some sort he had never handled. It looked like a 9mm Makarov or some other East Bloc military issue. The hammer was back and the safety off. He fitted the gun carefully in his right hand -- his left hand didn't seem to be working right, but Ryan ignored that. He looked down at the man he'd just tackled and shot him once in the hip. Then he brought the gun up to eye level and moved to the right rear corner of the Rolls. He crouched lower still and peeked around the edge of the bodywork.<br><br>The other gunman's AK was lying on the street and he was firing into the car with his own pistol, something else in his other hand. Ryan took a deep breath and stepped from behind the Rolls, leveling his automatic at the man's chest. The other gunman turned his head first, then swiveled off-balance to bring his own gun around. Both men fired at the same instant. Ryan felt a fiery thump in his left shoulder and saw his own round take the man in the chest. The 9mm slug knocked the man backward as though from a hard punch. Ryan brought his own pistol down from recoil and squeezed off another round. The second bullet caught the man under the chin and exploded out the back of his head in a wet, pink cloud. Like a puppet with severed strings, the gunman fell to the pavement without a twitch. Ryan kept his pistol centered on the man's chest until he saw what had happened to his head.<br><br>"Oh, God!" the surge of adrenaline left him as quickly as it had come. Time slowed back down to normal, and Ryan found himself suddenly dizzy and breathless. His mouth was open and gasping for air. Whatever force had been holding his body erect seemed to disappear, leaving his frame weak, on the verge of collapse. The black sedan backed up a few yards and accelerated past him, racing down the street, then turning left up a side street. Ryan didn't think to take the number. He was stunned by the flashing sequence of events with which his mind had still not caught up.</p><h2>Wildflowers of the Tallgrass Prairie: The Upper Midwest (Bur Oak Guide)</h2><p>This classic of midwestern natural history is back in print with a new format and new photographs.

In clear, straightforward, and accessible prose, authors Sylvan Runkel and Dean Roosa provide common, scientific, and family names; the Latin or Greek meaning of the scientific names; habitat and blooming times; and a complete description of plant, flower, and fruit. Particularly interesting is the information on the many ways in which Native Americans and early pioneers used these plants for everything from pain relief to dyes to hairbrushes. <br><br>Runkel and Roosa say that prairies can be among the most peaceful places on earth; certainly they are among the most beleaguered. <i>Wildflowers of the Tallgrass Prairie</i> will inspire both amateurs and professionals with the desire to learn more about the wonders of the prairie landscape.<br></p><p>Sylvan Runkel (1906&#x2013;1995) is the coauthor of five books about midwestern wildflowers, including <i>Wildflowers of the Iowa Woodlands </i>and <i>Wildflowers and Other Plants of Iowa Wetlands</i>.

Eighty-year-old Georgy Jachmenev is haunted by his past&#x2014;a past of death, suffering, and scandal that will stay with him until the end of his days. Living in England with his beloved wife, Zoya, Georgy prepares to make one final journey back to the Russia he once knew and loved, the Russia that both destroyed and defined him. As Georgy remembers days gone by, we are transported to St. Petersburg, to the Winter Palace of the czar, in the early twentieth century&#x2014;a time of change, threat, and bloody revolution. As Georgy overturns the most painful stone of all, we uncover the story of the house of special purpose.</p><p><b>John Boyne</b> was born in Ireland in 1971 and is the author of seven novels for adults and two for children. <i>The Boy in the Striped Pajama</i>s won two Irish Book Awards, was short-listed for the British Book Award, reached number one on the <i>New York Times</i> Best Sellers list, and was made into an award-winning Miramax feature film.

He lives in Dublin.<b>1981</b><br>&nbsp;<br>MY MOTHER AND FATHER did not have a happy marriage.<br>&nbsp;<br>Years have passed since I last endured their company, decades, but they pass through my thoughts almost every day for a few moments, no longer than that. A whisper of memory, as light as Zoya&#x2019;s breath upon my neck as she sleeps by my side at night. As gentle as her lips against my cheek when she kisses me in the first light of morning. I cannot say when they died exactly. I know nothing of their passing other than the natural certainty that they are no longer of this world. But I think of them. I think of them still.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have always imagined my father, Daniil Vladyavich, dying first. He was already in his early thirties by the time I was born and from what I can recall of him, he was never blessed with good health. I have memories of waking as an infant in our small timber-framed <i>izba </i>in Kashin, in the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, pressing my hands to my tiny ears to repel the sound of his mortality as he choked and coughed and spat his phlegm into the fire burning in our small stove. I think now that he may have had a problem with his lungs. Emphysema, perhaps. It&#x2019;s difficult to know. There were no doctors to administer to him. No medicines. Nor did he bear his many illnesses with fortitude or grace. When he suffered, we suffered too.<br>&nbsp;<br>His forehead extended in a grotesque fashion from his head, I remember that also. A great mass of misshapen membrane protruding with smaller distensions on either side of it, the skin stretched taut from hairline to the bridge of his nose, pulling his eyebrows north to give him an expression of permanent disquiet. My older sister, Liska, told me once that it was an accident of birth, an incompetent doctor taking hold of the cranium rather than the shoulders as he emerged into the world, pressing too hard on the soft, not yet solidified bone beneath. Or a lazy midwife, perhaps, careless with another woman&#x2019;s child. His mother did not live to see the creature she had produced, the deformed baby with his misshapen skull. The experience of giving my father life cost my grandmother her own. This was not unusual then and rarely a cause for grief; it was seen as a balance of nature. Today, it would be unexpected and worthy of litigation. My grandfather took another woman soon after, of course, to rear his young. <br>&nbsp;<br>When I was a boy, the other children in our village took fright when they saw my father walking along the road towards them, his eyes darting back and forth as he returned home from his farm labours, perhaps, or shaking his fist as he stepped out of a neighbour&#x2019;s hut after another argument over roubles owed or insults perceived. They had names for him and it excited them to shout these in his direction &#x2013; they called him Cerberus, after the threeheaded hound of Hades, and mocked him by pulling off their <i>kolpak</i>s and pressing their wrists to their foreheads, flapping them maniacally while chanting their war cries. They feared no retribution for behaving like this in front of me, his only son. I was small then and weak. They were not afraid of me. They pulled faces behind his back and spat on the ground in imitation of his habits, and when he turned to cry out like a wounded animal they would scatter, like grain seeds tossed across a field, disappearing into the landscape just as easily. They laughed at him; they thought him terrifying, monstrous and abhorrent all at once.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unlike them, I was afraid of my father, for he was liberal with his fists and unrepentant of his violence.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have no reason to imagine it so, but I picture him returning home some evening shortly after I made my escape from the railway carriage in Pskov on that cold March morning and being set upon by Bolsheviks in retaliation for what I had done. I see myself rushing across the tracks and disappearing into the forest beyond in fear of my life, while he shuffles along the road for home, coughing, hacking and spitting, unaware that his own is in mortal danger. In my arrogance, I imagine that my disappearance brought great shame upon my family and our small hamlet, a dishonour that demanded retribution. I picture a crowd of young men from the village &#x2013; in my dreams there are four of them; they are big and ugly and brutal &#x2013; bearing down upon him with cudgels, dragging him from the street towards the darkness of a high-walled lane in order to murder him without witness. I do not hear him crying out for mercy, that would not have been his way. I see blood on the stones where he lies. I glimpse a hand moving slowly, trembling, the fingers in spasm. And then lying still.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I think of my mother, Yulia Vladimirovna, I imagine her being called home to God in her own bed a few years later, hungry, exhausted, with my sisters keening by her side. I cannot imagine what hardships she must have faced after my father&#x2019;s death and I do not like to think of it, for despite the fact that she was a cold woman and betrayed her disappointment in me at every juncture of my childhood, she was my mother nevertheless and such a person is holy. I picture my eldest sister, Asya, placing a small portrait of me in her hands as she clasps them together for the final time in prayer, preparing in solemn penitence to meet her maker. The shroud is gathered to her thin neck, her face is white, her lips a pale shade of periwinkle blue. Asya loved me but envied my escape, I remember that too. She came to find me once and I turned her away. It shames me now to think of this.<br>&nbsp;<br>None of this may have happened, of course. The lives of my mother, my father and my sisters may have ended differently: happily, tragically, together, apart, in peace, in violence, there is no way for me to know. There was never a moment when I could have returned, never a chance that I could have written to Asya or Liska or even Talya, who might not have remembered her older brother, Georgy, her family&#x2019;s hero and shame. To return to them would have put them in danger, put me in danger, put Zoya in danger.<br>&nbsp;<br>But no matter how many years have passed, I think of them still. There are great stretches of my life that are a mystery to me, decades of work and family, struggle, betrayal, loss and disappointment that have blended together and are almost impossible to separate, but moments from those years, those early years, linger and resonate in my memory. And if they remain as shadows along the dark corridors of my ageing mind, then they are all the more vivid and remarkable for the fact that they can never be forgotten. Even if, soon, I shall be.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It has been more than sixty years since I last laid eyes on any member of my blood family. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to believe that I have lived to this age, eighty-two, and spent such a small proportion of my given time among them. I was remiss in my duties towards them, although I did not see it like that at the time. For I could no more have changed my destiny than altered the colour of my eyes. Circumstances led me from one moment to the next, and the next, and the next, as it does with any man, and I followed each step without question.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then one day I stopped. And I was old. And they were gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Do their bodies remain in a state of decomposition, I wonder, or have they already dissolved and become one with the dust? Does the act of putrefaction take several generations to complete or can it advance at a faster rate, dependent on the age of the body or the conditions of burial? And the speed of corporeal decay, does that depend on the quality of the wood from which one&#x2019;s coffin is made? The appetite of the soil? The climate? In the past, these are the types of questions that I might have pondered over while distracted from my night-time reading. Typically, I would have made a note of my query and researched it until a satisfactory answer had been arrived at, but my routines have all fallen apart this year and such investigations seem trivial to me now. Indeed, I have not been to the library for many months, not since before Zoya became ill. I may never go there again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of my life &#x2013; most of my adult life, that is &#x2013; has been spent within the tranquil walls of the library at the British Museum. I began my employment there in the early autumn of 1923, shortly after Zoya and I first arrived in London, cold, fearful, certain that we might yet be discovered. I was twenty-four years old at the time and had never known that employment could be so peaceful. It had been five years since I had shed the symbols of my previous life &#x2013; uniforms, rifles, bombs, explosions &#x2013; but I remained branded by their memory. Now it was soft cotton suits, filing cabinets and erudition, a welcome change.<br>&nbsp;<br>And before London, of course, was Paris, where I developed that interest in books and literature that had first begun in the Blue Library, a curiosity that I hoped to pursue in England. To my eternal good fortune, I noticed an advertisement in <i>The Times </i>for a junior librarian in the British Museum and I applied in person later that day, hat in hand, and was immediately taken in to meet a Mr Arthur Trevors, my potential new employer.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can remember the date exactly. August the twelfth. I had just come from the Cathedral of the Dormition and All Saints where I had lit a candle for an old friend, an annual gesture of respect to mark his birthday. <i>For as long as I live</i>, I had promised him all those years ago. It seemed appropriate, somehow, that my new life was to commence on the same day that his own short life had begun.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Do you know how long the British Library has existed, Mr Jachmenev?&#x2019; he asked me, peering over the top of a pair of half-moon spectacles, which were perched uselessly towards the base of his nose. He didn&#x2019;t struggle even slightly with my name, which impressed me since so many English people seemed to make a virtue out of being unable to pronounce it. &#x2018;Since 1753,&#x2019; he replied immediately, giving me no opportunity to hazard a guess. &#x2018;When Sir Hans Sloan bequeathed his collection of books and curiosities to the nation, and thus the entire museum was born. What do you think of that?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I could scarcely think of any response other than to praise Sir Hans for his philanthropy and common sense, a reply which Mr Trevors wholeheartedly approved of.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re absolutely right, Mr Jachmenev,&#x2019; he said, nodding his head furiously. &#x2018;He was a most excellent fellow. My greatgrandfather played bridge with him regularly. The difficulty now, of course, is one of space. We&#x2019;re running out of it, you see. Too many books being produced, that&#x2019;s the problem. Most of them written by half-wits, atheists or sodomites, but God help us, we&#x2019;re obliged to carry them all. You don&#x2019;t have any truck with that faction, do you, Mr Jachmenev?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I shook my head quickly. &#x2018;No, sir,&#x2019; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Glad to hear it. Some day we hope to move the library to its own premises, of course, and that&#x2019;ll help matters no end. But it&#x2019;s all down to Parliament. They control all our money, you see. And you know what those fellows are like. Rotten to the core, every last one of them. This Baldwin chap&#x2019;s frightfully good, but other than him . . .&#x2019; He shook his head and looked as if he might be ill.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the silence that followed, I could think of nothing to recommend myself other than to speak of my admiration for the museum, which I had spent a mere half-hour in before my interview, and the astonishing collection of treasures which were gathered inside its walls.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ve worked in a museum before, Mr Jachmenev, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x2019; he asked me and I shook my head. He appeared surprised by my answer and took off his glasses as he questioned me further. &#x2018;I thought perhaps you were an employee of the Hermitage? In St Petersburg?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>He did not need to qualify the name of the museum with its location; I knew it well enough. For a moment I regretted not having lied, for after all it was unlikely that he would seek proof of my employment there and any attempt to seek references would take years to achieve, if they arrived at all.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I never worked there, sir,&#x2019; I replied. &#x2018;But of course I am very familiar with it. I spent many hundreds of happy hours at the Hermitage. The Byzantine collection is particularly impressive. As are the Numismatics.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>He considered this for a moment, trilling his fingers along the side of his desk, before deciding that he was satisfied with my response. Leaning back in his chair, he narrowed his eyes and breathed heavily through his nose as he stared at me. &#x2018;Tell me, Mr Jachmenev,&#x2019; he said, dragging each word out as if their elocution was painful to him. &#x2018;How long have you been in England?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Not long,&#x2019; I told him truthfully. &#x2018;A few weeks.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You came directly from Russia?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;No, sir. My wife and I spent several years in France before&#x2014;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Your wife? You&#x2019;re a married man, then?&#x2019; he asked, appearing pleased by my admission.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Yes, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Her name?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Zoya,&#x2019; I told him. &#x2018;A Russian name, of course. It means <i>life</i>.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Does it indeed?&#x2019; he muttered, staring at me as if my statement had been entirely presumptuous. &#x2018;How charming. And how did you make your living in France?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I worked in a Parisian bookshop,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Of average size, but with a loyal client base. There were no quiet days.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;And you enjoyed the work?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Very much.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Why was that?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;It was peaceful,&#x2019; I replied. &#x2018;Even though I was always busy, there was a serenity to the atmosphere that appealed greatly to me.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Well, that&#x2019;s how we run things here too,&#x2019; he said cheerfully. &#x2018;Nice and quiet, but lots of hard work. And before France, you travelled extensively throughout Europe, I expect?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Not really, sir,&#x2019; I admitted. &#x2018;Before France was Russia.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Escaping the revolution, were you?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;We left in 1918,&#x2019; I replied. &#x2018;A year after it took place.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Didn&#x2019;t care for the new regime, I suppose?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;No, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Quite right too,&#x2019; he remarked, his lip curling a little in distaste at the thought of it. &#x2018;Bloody Bolsheviks. The Tsar was a cousin of King George, did you know that?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I was aware of that, yes, sir,&#x2019; I replied.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;And his wife, Mrs Tsar, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;The Tsaritsa,&#x2019; I said, carefully correcting his irreverence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Yes, if you must. It&#x2019;s a damn cheek, if you ask me. Something should be done about them before they spread their filthy ways across Europe. You know that chap Lenin used to study here at the library, of course?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;No, I didn&#x2019;t,&#x2019; I said, raising an eyebrow in surprise.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Oh it&#x2019;s quite true, I assure you,&#x2019; he said, sensing my scepticism. &#x2018;Sometime around 1901 or 1902, I believe. Well before my time. My predecessor told me all about it. He said that Lenin used to arrive every morning around nine and stay until lunchtime when that wife of his would arrive to drag him off to edit their revolutionary rag. He tried to smuggle flasks of coffee in all the time but we were on to him.

Its efforts focused on improving the lives of sharecroppers, tenants, and very poor landowning farmers, with resettlement and collectivization programs, as well as modernized farming methods. In a parallel documentation program, the FSA hired a number of photographers and writers to record the lives of the rural poor and &#x201c;introduce America to Americans.&#x201d;</p><p>This book records the full reach of the FSA program from 1935 to 1943, honoring its vigor and commitment across subjects, states, and stylistic preferences.

They are telling stories of how you can benefit from this natural water cure and not to subject yourself to the invasive and toxic drug treatment.</p><p>Fereydoon Batmanghelidj, M.D. <p>Dr. F. Batmanghelidj (Batman-ge-lij), American citizen, was born in Iran in 1931. He attended school in Scotland, and received his medical training at London University&#x2019;s St. Mary&#x2019;s Hospital Medical School. Upon completion of his studies, he had the privilege of being selected as a house doctor in his own medical school. Dr. Batmanghelidj practiced medicine in England before returning to Iran where he helped develop hospitals, and a family charity teaching medical center. </p><p>When revolution broke out in 1979, Dr. Batmanghelidj, as a member of a prominent family, was thrown in jail and was slated to be shot. While waiting to be "processed" as a political prisoner in Evin prison, he discovered the healing power of water. </p><p>One night, Dr. Batmanghelidj had to treat a fellow prisoner with crippling peptic ulcer pain. With no medications at his disposal, Dr. Batmanghelidj gave him two glasses of water. Within eight minutes, his pain disappeared. He was instructed to drink two glasses of water every three hours. He became absolutely pain-free for the four remaining months he was in prison. Without using any medication, he was cured. This discovery of the medicinal property of water at Evin saved the Doctor's life. The authorities now wanted to be associated with his discovery. </p><p>In 31 months of his imprisonment, Dr. Batmanghelidj treated over 3,000 peptic ulcer sufferers with water alone. He conducted extensive research into the medicinal effects of water. He discovered water could prevent, relieve and cure many painful, degenerative diseases. Evin prison proved an "ideal stress laboratory," and despite being offered an earlier release, he chose to stay an extra four months in prison to complete his research into the relationship of dehydration and bleeding peptic ulcer disease. The report of his findings was published as the editorial of the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology in June 1983. The New York Times Science section reported this discovery. </p><p>Upon his release in 1982, Dr. Batmanghelidj escaped from Iran and came to America. At "Foundation for the Simple in Medicine" he began research of the effect of chronic unintentional dehydration on the human body. His findings were published in their "Journal of Science in Medicine Simplified" in 1991 and 1992. </p><p>His research produced a paradigm shift in the basic science of medicine. As the guest lecturer of an international Cancer Conference, he explained that pain and the degenerative diseases, including cancers, are produced by dehydration in the human body. His article, "Pain: A Need for Paradigm Change," was published in the "Journal of Anticancer Research" in 1987. </p><p>For the first time in medical history, at the 3rd Interscience World Conference on Inflammation in 1989, Dr. Batmanghelidj explained that histamine is a neurotransmitter in charge of water regulation and drought-management programs of the body&#x2014;the medical breakthrough people have been waiting for. </p><p>With his radio and TV interviews, Dr. Batmanghelidj is now promoting professional and public awareness of the healing power of water. His book, "Your Body Many Cries for Water," has helped millions of people. </p><p>He has written five books in English: "Your Body&#x2019;s Many Cries for Water," which has been translated into many languages, "How to Deal with Back pain &amp; Rheumatoid Joint Pain"; " ABC of Asthma, Allergies and Lupus"; "Water: for Health, for Healing, for Life" (published by Warner Books) and "Water Cures: Drugs Kill." He as four videotapes, "Cure Pain &amp; Prevent Cancer"; "Dehydration &amp; Cancer"; "Health Miracles in Water &amp; Salt" and "How to Deal with Back Pain.". His most recent article, "Waiting to get Thirsty is to Die Prematurely and Painfully" is published in the Townsend Letters for Doctors and Patients in January, 2003.</p></p><h2>Fairycraft: Following The Path Of Fairy Witchcraft</h2><p>An in-depth manual for practicing Fairy Witchcraft including theology, fairy lore, rituals, holidays, and magical practices.

Taken from his personal writings, these private reflections reveal the development of his own thought and personality, from his time as a young student to the deep later internal conflict that formed the basis for his masterpiece of duality <i>Either/Or</i> and beyond. Expressing his beliefs with a freedom not seen in works he published during his lifetime, Kierkegaard here rejects for the first time his father's conventional Christianity and forges the revolutionary idea of the "leap of faith" required for true religious belief. A combination of theoretical argument, vivid natural description and sharply honed wit, the <i>Papers and Journals</i> reveal to the full the passionate integrity of his lifelong efforts "to find a truth which is truth for me."<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

His childhood was unhappy, clouded by the religious fervour of his father, and the death of his mother, his sisters and two brothers. Educated at the School of Civic Virtue, he went on study theology, liberal arts and science at university, gaining a reputation for his academic brilliance and extravagant social life. He began to criticize Christianity, and in 1841 broke off his engagement to concentrate on his writing. Over the next ten years he produced a flood of works, in particular twelve major philosophical essays, many written under noms de plume. By the end of his life he had become an object of public ridicule, but he is now enjoying increasing acclaim.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Alastair Hannay</b>&nbsp;was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, the University of Edinburgh and University College London.

The same night I spotted two armed men in my coffeehouse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Back up, sweetheart. <i>What</i> armed men?&#x201d;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s where her story began&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One</p><p>&#x201c;GARDNER, get off the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just do it!&#x201d;</p><p>Still panting from my upstairs sprint, I counted the seconds, waiting for my young co-manager to end his call.</p><p>Like the rest of this former bakery, the top floor of our rented building felt as big as a barn. Tall windows bathed the place in sunshine&#x2014;when the sun was up, that is. Nights were a different story.</p><p>None of the fireplaces were working yet, which made this high-ceilinged beauty impossible to properly heat; and on this moonless February evening, in heels, hose, and a little blue dress, I hugged myself to suppress a shiver.</p><p>Our DC location hadn&#x2019;t always been a bakery. Around 1865, it became a confectionary shop with an ice cream parlor so beloved that the Smithsonian&#x2019;s Museum of American History preserved a portion of its interior in its Hall of Everyday Life.</p><p><i>My</i> everyday life wasn&#x2019;t nearly so fixed.</p><p>At first my move here had been a joy. My elderly employer had found me an elegant situation, house-sitting a historic Georgetown mansion.</p><p>Madame Dreyfus Allegro Dubois had made flocks of influential friends in her eighty-plus years running her New York coffee business, so I wasn&#x2019;t surprised that among them was the absent owner of said mansion.</p><p>Madame had even bunked with me for a few weeks to help us open our DC doors&#x2014;and cut some red tape for a temporary liquor license. Then she headed back to New York, and for the next two months, I settled into a routine with my co-manager, a talented African American jazz musician named Gardner Evans who&#x2019;d worked for years as a part-time barista in our New York shop.</p><p>Hailing from the Baltimore area, Gard had harbored a childhood dream to open a jazz club in Washington; and, given the longtime success of the legendary Blues Alley (just down the avenue from our DC digs), our elderly owner was thrilled to give the concept her blessing, as well as her funding.</p><p>After all, Georgetown was a picturesque, historically preserved neighborhood with collegiate ties and bohemian leanings, much like the Greenwich Village location of our original Village Blend. It seemed the perfect way to expand our century-old family business, a dream Madame had been fostering in recent years.</p><p>As for my dream, it had less to do with business than a man named Michael Ryan Francis Quinn&#x2014;NYPD detective by trade, training, and instinct&#x2014;who was now on temporary assignment at the United States Department of Justice.</p><p>The protracted duration of Quinn&#x2019;s supposedly &#x201c;transitory&#x201d; duty was compelling enough for me to relocate. In plain speaking: <i>I missed the man.</i> As a result, I&#x2019;d agreed to help Gard get this DC branch of our Village Blend coffee business up on its feet&#x2014;unfortunately, after eight weeks of coaxing, this promising baby was still on its knees.</p><p>I handled the day-shift coffee business on the first floor, which was decent, but it wasn&#x2019;t brisk enough to carry the jazz club, which was hemorrhaging money.</p><p>Gardner managed the club, and we agreed the music wasn&#x2019;t the problem; it was the food. (One recent devastating print review and a dozen online reviews concurred.) That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;d asked me to stop by this evening and evaluate the menu issues, which I&#x2019;d been doing, table by table&#x2014;until I spotted the man with the gun.</p><p>Keeping my cool, I moved slowly to the stairs and raced up them.</p><p>Now I stood before Gardner in our small office on the third floor. He and I shared the space. The rest of this large top floor served other purposes, including a small apartment that Gard used and a &#x201c;greenroom&#x201d; for the performers he booked. At the moment, however, I regretted the floor plan didn&#x2019;t include an armory.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, talk to me&#x2014;&#x201d; Gardner said, putting down his phone. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re about to be robbed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?!&#x201d; His espresso-hued eyes went wide. &#x201c;Have you called the police?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because nothing&#x2019;s happened yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then what makes you think&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Remember that holdup in the news last week? The bistro on Connecticut Avenue? Two armed men took wallets, smartphones, and jewelry at gunpoint. The perps waited at separate tables for the right time to strike. Well, I think I&#x2019;ve spotted them downstairs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the coffeehouse?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, the club. As I was chatting up customers, I came upon this man, sitting alone, wearing a baseball jacket. He&#x2019;s not eating or drinking alcohol, just sipping a Coke. He&#x2019;s scanning the room, hardly paying attention to the stage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d; Gardner smoothed his goatee. &#x201c;There could be any number of reasons why&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Except a big, bald guy, at the opposite end of the room, is doing the same thing&#x2014;and making occasional eye contact with the first man. When I moved closer, I saw the gun in the big guy&#x2019;s suit jacket!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s strapped?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did either of these guys notice you noticing them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could feel their eyes on me as I crossed the dining room, but I don&#x2019;t know that they know I know.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Gardner was on his feet. &#x201c;Do they look Middle Eastern?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why does that matter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You never heard of prejudiced profiling? We call the cops and we&#x2019;re wrong, they could sue us for discrimination, defamation, harassment!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose the guy in the baseball jacket could pass for a Saudi.&#x201d;</p><p>Gardner moaned.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not panic,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to involve the police, but we can do it carefully. Business has been pretty lousy around here without bad publicity killing it completely&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or a lawsuit!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have an idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all ears.&#x201d;</p><p>I explained my plan, and Gardner nodded. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it. But I still hope you&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That makes two of us.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>I led the way down the stairs to our second floor Jazz Space. Sweet music flowed from the low stage, where three members of Gardner&#x2019;s own band, Four on the Floor, were wrapping up their first set.</p><p>We entered the dining area behind the polished coffee and wine bar. Our young, Italian bartender was helping out on the floor, along with our sole server for the evening.</p><p>To keep us from spooking these robbers, I directed Gardner to turn his back on the customers and gaze instead into the ornate mirror mounted behind the long bar. The LED light star field on the twilight blue ceiling and opposite wall were reflected there, along with tonight&#x2019;s sparsely occupied tables.</p><p>As Gardner prepared a drink, I pretended to help.</p><p>&#x201c;Where do I look?&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;By the exit to the restroom. See the big bald guy in a suit? He&#x2019;s the one I know is armed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>As Gardner observed the man, the band ended their set.</p><p>Stan &#x201c;Sticks&#x201d; McGuire, the band&#x2019;s wiry new drummer, grabbed his Hoover cane. Stan had a permanent limp, unruly brown hair, and tremendous energy. Despite his leg injury and visual impairment&#x2014;a blind eye, which he masked with a Captain America eyepatch&#x2014;he moved smoothly off the stage, unassisted.</p><p>Jackson placed his bass into its stand and grabbed the microphone.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, folks. Now it&#x2019;s time for us to clear out so you can listen to our Open Mike favorite. ...</p></p><h2>Recovering the Scandal of the Cross: Atonement in New Testament and Contemporary Contexts</h2><p>For the first-century Roman world the cross was first and foremost an instrument of shameful and violent execution. But early Christians, who had seen their world upended by the atoning power of the cross of Christ, came to view it in an entirely different light. Deeply scandalous, it was paradoxically glorious. For the cross of Christ marked the epochal saving event in God's dealings with Israel and the world. And its meaning could not be fathomed or encircled by a single image or formulation. Since its publication in 2000, <em>Recovering the Scandal of the Cross</em> has initiated among evangelicals a new conversation about the nature of the atonement and how it should be expressed in the varied and global contexts of today. In this second edition Green and Baker have clarified and enlarged their argument in a way that will continue to provoke thought and conversation on this critical topic.</p><p><strong>Mark D. Baker</strong> is associate professor of mission and theology at Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary. He is also the editor of <em>Proclaiming the Scandal of the Cross</em>.<br><br><strong>Joel B. Green</strong> is associate dean for the Center for Advanced Theological Studies and professor of New Testament interpretation at Fuller Theological Seminary. He is the author and editor of many books on the New Testament, including a major commentary on the Gospel of Luke."Recovering the scandalous nature of the cross demands, Green and Baker think, taking seriously the "melange of voices" present in the New Testament, the power and mechanics of metaphorical language, and the impact of culture on the way we think and speak. These are weighty and at times difficult matters; it is <em>Recovering the Scandal's</em> greatest strength that each is treated accurately and comprehensively without ever lapsing into inaccessible acadmic jargon." (Thomas Andrew Bennett, Fuller Theology News Notes, Fall 2012)<br><br>"Here is a fresh look at the cross of Jesus. . . . I highly recommend it to all Christians who . . . seek to understand and articulate with integrity the saving significance of the cross of Jesus in our postmodern world." (John Driver, Goshen College)<br><br>"Joel Green and Mark Baker offer a richly-textured interpretation which does justice both to the variety of models of atonement in the Bible and to the varieties of postmodern culture. This is thought-provoking theology for a mission context." (Stephen Travis, formerly Vice-Principal of St. John's College, Nottingham UK)<br><br>"In the second edition of <em>Recovering the Scandal of the Cross,</em> Baker and Green continue the important conversation about the doctrine of the atonement by responding to new proposals and to critics of the book's first edition. . . . Most helpful is their insightful treatment of non-Western views of the cross which pushes forward evangelical attempts at cultural contextualization without sheer accommodation. Everyone interested in cutting-edge theological thinking about the atonement must read this second edition." (Roger E. Olson, professor of theology, George W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University)<br><br>"By focusing on the importance of narrative context, language and metaphor, this book recaptures some of the mystery and complexity of New Testament views of atonement. Besides engaging recent debates on the salvific meaning of the crucifixion, this revised edition surveys New Testament, historical, and contemporary models of the atonement, revealing unintended side effects of a contemporary model of penal satisfaction. Scholars and pastors will gain from the insights of this clear and well-researched study--one that shows the necessity of doing theology that relates to the mission of the church in every context and generation."

This text develops lessons around readings on Chinese history, culture, geography, literature, folktales and mythology, customs, and cuisine.</p><p><p>Duanduan Li is director of the Chinese Language Program at the University of British Columbia; Irene Liu was the previous director of the Chinese Language Program at Columbia University, and Lening Liu is the present director; Yanping Xie, a speech and language pathologist, was a lecturer of Chinese in the Columbia program; Hailong Wang and Zhirong Wang are lecturers of Chinese in the Columbia program.</p></p><h2>Art and Objects</h2><p><p>In this book, the founder of object-oriented ontology develops his view that aesthetics is the central discipline of philosophy. Whereas science must attempt to grasp an object in terms of its observable qualities, philosophy and art cannot proceed in this way because they don't have direct access to their objects. Hence philosophy shares the same fate as art in being compelled to communicate indirectly, allusively, or elliptically, rather than in the clear propositional terms that are often taken &#x2013; wrongly &#x2013; to be the sole stuff of genuine philosophy.</p> <p>Conceiving of philosophy and art in this way allows us to reread key debates in aesthetic theory and to view art history in a different way. The formalist criticism of Greenberg and Fried is rejected for its refusal to embrace the innate theatricality and deep multiplicity of every artwork. This has consequences for art criticism, making pictorial content more important than formalism thinks but less entwined with the social sphere than anti-formalism holds. It has consequences for art history too, as the surrealists, David, and Poussin, among others, gain in importance. The close link between aesthetics and ontology also invites a new periodization of modern philosophy as a whole, and the habitual turn away from Kant&#x2019;s thing-in-itself towards an increase in philosophical "immanence" is shown to be a false dawn.</p> <p>This major work will be of great interest to students and scholars of philosophy, aesthetics, art history and cultural theory.</p></p><p><b>Graham Harman</b> is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (on leave from the American University in Cairo).</p><h2>Contemporary Trusts and Estates [Connected eBook with Study Center] (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p><p>Buy a <strong>new version</strong> of this Connected Casebook and receive <strong>ACCESS</strong> to the <strong>online e-book</strong>, <strong>practice questions </strong>from your favorite study aids, and an <strong>outline tool</strong> on CasebookConnect, the all in one learning solution for law school students.

A mountain of new facts and mechanisms has emerged. And yet a principled framework to organize this knowledge has been missing. In this book, Peter Sterling and Simon Laughlin, two leading neuroscientists, strive to fill this gap, outlining a set of organizing principles to explain the whys of neural design that allow the brain to compute so efficiently. </p><p>Setting out to &#x201c;reverse engineer&#x201d; the brain&#x2015;disassembling it to understand it&#x2015;Sterling and Laughlin first consider why an animal should need a brain, tracing computational abilities from bacterium to protozoan to worm. They examine bigger brains and the advantages of &#x201c;anticipatory regulation&#x201d;; identify constraints on neural design and the need to &#x201c;nanofy&#x201d;; and demonstrate the routes to efficiency in an integrated molecular system, phototransduction. They show that the principles of neural design at finer scales and lower levels apply at larger scales and higher levels; describe neural wiring efficiency; and discuss learning as a principle of biological design that includes &#x201c;save only what is needed.&#x201d;</p><p>Sterling and Laughlin avoid speculation about how the brain <i>might</i> work and endeavor to make sense of what is already known.

Further, Rappaport presents provocative new insights on shareholder value applications to: (1) business planning, (2) performance evaluation, (3) executive compensation, (4) mergers and acquisitions, (5) interpreting stock market signals, and (6) organizational implementation. Readers will be particularly interested in Rappaport's answers to three management performance evaluation questions: (1) What is the most appropriate measure of performance? (2) What is the most appropriate target level of performance? and (3) How should rewards be linked to performance? The recent acquisition of Duracell International by Gillette is analyzed in detail, enabling the reader to understand the critical information needed when assessing the risks and rewards of a merger from both sides of the negotiating table.<br> <br>The shareholder value approach presented here has been widely embraced by publicly traded as well as privately held companies worldwide. Brilliant and incisive, this is the one book that should be required reading for managers and investors who want to stay on the cutting edge of success in a highly competitive global economy.</p><p>Should a company's management be most accountable to employees, customers, or management itself? In <i>Creating Shareholder Value</i>, Alfred Rappaport argues that management's primary responsibility is to company shareholders. First published 12 years ago, the ideas put forth by Rappaport have since become commonplace in companies around the world.<p> Rappaport eschews the most common measures of a company's performance, such as price-to-earnings ratios ("Cash is a fact, profit is an opinion"), return on investment, and equity measures, instead concentrating on developing a shareholder value approach that measures "value drivers" such as sales-growth rates, operating profit margins, and cost of capital. This revised and updated edition addresses the issues of corporate downsizing and the social responsibilities of business. It also includes new sections on the value of mergers and acquisitions and how to implement a shareholder value system. Both managers and investors alike will find this book useful.</p>Dr. Alfred Happaport, the Leonard Spacek Professor Emeritus of J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, developed the idea for the Shareholder Scoreboard, published annually by <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i> He is co-founder and former Chairman of the Board of The Alcar Group Inc., whose consulting and education practices are now part of The LEK/Alcar Consulting Group, LLC, the U.S. operation of a worldwide strategy consulting firm.

For many people, this means scrambling to survive the long winter with even less food. Some were smart enough to spend the summer preparing for the changing season and the expanding effects of the Collapse; others were not so smart, and their desperation and fear grows stronger by the day. Grant Matson reflects with pride on how he has provided for his family while guiding Pierce Point into a community that functions well on its own. Celebrating this accomplishment, Grant and others join to offer the community a Thanksgiving dinner, which is met with gratitude and exhilaration. This mood is short-lived, however, as circumstance quickly begin to unravel, beginning with the disappearance of a beloved community member, followed shortly by a self-defensive killing by another. The situation is just as bleak, or worse, in other parts of Washington State and the country, as innocent people are imprisoned and murdered, women and children become commodities, and what is left of the government looks even less like the once-beloved United States of America. As the threat of a civil war becomes imminent, Grant, the Team, and the 17th Irregulars at Marion Farm bond over their duty to protect the country and are soon a fully-formed combat-ready unity, excited to go into combat but uncertain of what will happen to them. Grant dreads what he knows is coming, but he understands that he has been called to sacrifice - potentially his life and probably his marriage - to stop the Loyalists from hurting more people.</p><p></p><h2>Just Call Me Kate (True Girl Fiction)</h2><p><p>Sixth-grader Kate Harding has bigger problems than trying to get her parents to stop calling her "Katie."

Like Paul blinded by righteousness and beauty.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air in my house still carried her warm chocolate-and-pepper scent.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I hadn&#x2019;t intended Tatina to see during her time in Detroit was a black Chevy Suburban, windows blackedout, crawling down Markham Street at ungodly hours of the morning. Tatina had casually noted the SUV twice during her nighttime bathroom visits.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; she asked over breakfast one morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Probably somebody coming home from a late shift somewhere.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I knew better.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Mexicantown. The black Chevy Suburban with blacked out windows was ICE&#x2014;US Immigration and Customs Enforcement police&#x2014;trolling in the dark-heart hours, mapping potential &#x201c;nests&#x201d; and safe-houses of undocumented immigrants. Their official motto? &#x201c;Protecting National Security and Upholding Public Safety.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mexicantown, we have a different motto for ICE: <i>Si es marr�n, enci�rrelo</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s brown, lock it down.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Please, Jesus lord,&#x201d; Jimmy Radmon said as he entered through my front door. &#x201c;Tell me I ain&#x2019;t seein&#x2019; this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was carefully ladling my now-completed salsa into six shiny, sterilized Ball fourteen-ounce storage jars. Celia Cruz had just finished her sexy take on &#x201c;Oye Como Va.&#x201d; Now I was doing a rhumba bolero to James Brown&#x2019;s <i>Hot Pants-Pt. 1</i>. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You need to learn the rhumba, Jimmy,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What I need to learn that goofy stuff for?&#x201d; Jimmy said, walking around me and retrieving an ice-cold bottle of water from my fridge. I kept bottled water in the fridge just for Jimmy and Carlos. They seemed never to be finished making little adjustments, improvements and additions to my house. I didn&#x2019;t really mind, since most of these were invisible to me. One of their last improvements made my house a virtual Wi-Fi hotspot for the other houses on Markham Street. Not a bad thing since most neighborhoods in Detroit were Internet dead zones.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found space in the fridge for four of the six jars of salsa and handed two to Jimmy. One for him, one for his loving landlords, my older neighbors Sylvia and Carmela.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You should sell this stuff,&#x201d; Jimmy said, scrutinizing the jars. &#x201c;Octavio&#x2019;s Genu-wine D-City Salsa. It&#x2019;s good. Better than store-bought.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; I said, knowing I wouldn&#x2019;t think about it. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfied with the success of my culinary mission, I grabbed a beer&#x2014;a Batch Brewing Vienna Lager&#x2014;and retired to the living room. Jimmy followed along, insisting on boring me with renovation status reports, material and equipment requests and subcontractor bids. We&#x2019;d just flipped two houses&#x2014;a detached brick three-bedroom to a young couple who&#x2019;d moved here from Portland with their three-year-old girl, and a two-bedroom brick duplex to some English charitable foundation guy who insisted on wearing his hair in a man-bun and doing yoga on his front porch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there were the inevitable local newspaper and magazine inquiries.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This Renna Jacobs from the <i>Free Press</i>, man, she keep on calling me,&#x201d; Jimmy said. &#x201c;Wants to talk to you about bringin&#x2019; the &#x2019;hood back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t give her my number, did you?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, on account I know you&#x2019;d kill me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn straight,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Probably by making you give up Cheetos and Gatorade and force-feeding you healthy food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; Jimmy insisted. &#x201c;A little press be nice for the &#x2019;hood. <i>And </i>for me and Carlos. I mean, we all got to think outside the Markham Street box, Mr. Snow. One house left to reno and flip on the street&#x2014;then what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy had just asked a question that I&#x2019;d been avoiding for the past three months. I never intended for house renovations in the southwest Detroit neighborhood of Mexicantown to become my purpose in life. I just wanted my neighborhood&#x2014;my street&#x2014;back. Maybe homage to my beloved parents. Maybe reverence for a long-ago way of life that in this moment seemed to hold no more weight than spirits wandering far from their graves.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being fired from the Detroit Police Department, the trial that followed and my twelve-million-dollar wrongful dismissal award, I&#x2019;d wanted nothing more than to isolate my shattered self in a safe place. That had been the whole reason I&#x2019;d renovated my childhood home on Markham Street in the first place, and then, by extension, the neighboring houses toward Mexicantown&#x2019;s business thoroughfare, Vernor Avenue.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Markham Street&#x2014;and August Octavio Snow&#x2014;2.0.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I had a couple good men depending on me for their livelihood.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I had no answers for them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy gave me a sideways look that said he&#x2019;d heard this from me before. &#x201c;Yeah, well, either way,&#x201d; Jimmy said, tearing a small portion of paper from his work notebook and handing the shred to me, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s that reporter&#x2019;s number. A &#x2018;neighborhood renaissance,&#x2019;&#x201d; Jimmy persisted. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what this reporter lady calls what you done did around here. And, I mean, talkin&#x2019; to her might be a nice chance for you to do some reno on your reputation in this town, you know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feared Jimmy had stepped over a line and into my personal minefield.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this was Jimmy. A kid who was, by nature, innocent&#x2014;maybe even na�ve&#x2014;and without a malicious bone in his rail-thin body.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What reputation might that be, Jimmy?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;&#x2018;Ex-cop who took twelve mil from raggedy-ass Detroit reinvests in raggedy-ass Detroit,&#x2019;&#x201d; Jimmy said. &#x201c;Hometown hero stuff. You could make this work for you, Mr. Snow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Like I said, Jimmy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, I know,&#x201d; Jimmy said. &#x201c;&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll think about it.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><h2>13 Women Artists Children Should Know</h2><p>This book teaches a young audience about the works and lives of thirteen women artists through informative texts, puzzles, coloring exercises, and fun quizzes.

Tired of the famous and crowded rivers, today&#x2019;s anglers have a greater desire to get close to nature while staying closer to home. The Orvis Guide to Small Stream Fly Fishing provides all the information for finding and fishing unspoiled gems found everywhere from wilderness areas to suburban backyards. These often overlooked streams are abundant throughout the United States, and range from the Appalachians&#x2014;from Maine to Georgia&#x2014;to northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, the Black Hills of South Dakota, the entire Rocky Mountain region from Montana to northern Arizona, and the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges. As more fishing is done close to home, small trout streams, or third-order streams as described by hydrologists, are thirty times as abundant as the bigger, more famous trout streams and most of them are on public land, making them more accessible. This beautifully illustrated and definitive resource explains the small stream environment, how to find these streams, how small-stream trout behave, how to read the water, special casts, fly selection, and how to present the fly in all types of small streams. With this book, anglers can find and catch wild trout far off the beaten path.</p><p><p><b>Tom Rosenbauer</b> is a lifelong fly fisher and has been named 2011 Angler of the Year by <i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i> <i>Magazine</i>.

The book goes beyond being a small stream manual that&#x2019;s packed with technical information: its real value lies in the fact that it will really encourage you to get out there, seek out a small stream - and fish it." <b>~</b><i>Fly Fishing Insider</i></p><h2>The Best of Archy and Mehitabel: Introduction by E. B. White (Everyman&#39;s Library Pocket Poets Series)</h2><p>A selection of the best of the hilarious free-verse poems by the irreverent cockroach poet Archy and his alley-cat pal Mehitabel.<br><br>Don Marquis&#x2019;s famous fictional insect appeared in his newspaper columns from 1916 into the 1930s, and he has delighted generations of readers ever since. A poet in a former life, Archy was reincarnated as a bug who expresses himself by diving headfirst onto a typewriter. His sidekick Mehitabel is a streetwise feline who claims to have been Cleopatra in a previous life. As E. B. White wrote in his now-classic introduction, the Archy poems &#x201c;contain cosmic reverberations along with high comedy&#x201d; and have &#x201c;the jewel-like perfection of poetry.&#x201d;<br><br>Adorned with George Herriman&#x2019;s whimsical illustrations and including White&#x2019;s introduction, our Pocket Poets selection&#x2014;the only hardcover <i>Archy and Mehitabel </i>in print&#x2014;is a beautiful volume, and perfectly sized for its tiny hero.</p><p>Don Marquis (1878&#x2013;1937) was a journalist and columnist in New York City and the author of several novels, short-story collections, and plays.<br><br>E. B. White (1899&#x2013;1985) was a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning writer, <i>New Yorker</i> contributor, and author of <i>Stuart Little and Charlotte&#x2019;s Web.</i><b>Introduction<br>by E. B. White<br><br></b>When the publisher asked me to write a few introductory remarks about Don Marquis for this new edition of <i>archy and mehitabel</i>, he said in his letter: &#x2018;&#x2018;The sales of this particular volume have been really astounding.&#x2019;&#x2019;<b><br><br></b>They do not astound me. Among books of humor by American authors, there are only a handful that rest solidly on the shelf. This book about Archy and Mehitabel, hammered out at such awful cost by the bug hurling himself at the keys, is one of those books. It is funny, it is wise, it is tender, and it is tough. The sales do not astound me; only the author astounds me, for I know (or think I do) at what cost Don Marquis produced these gaudy and irreverent tales. He was the sort of poet who does not create easily; he was left unsatisfied and gloomy by what he produced; day and night he felt the juices squeezed out of him by the merciless demands of daily newspaper work; he was never quite certified by intellectuals and serious critics of belles lettres. He ended in an exhausted condition &#x2013; his money gone, his strength gone. Describing the coming of Archy in the Sun Dial column of the New York <i>Sun</i> one afternoon in 1916, he wrote: &#x2018;&#x2018;After about an hour of this frightfully difficult literary labor he fell to the floor exhausted, and we saw him creep feebly into a nest of the poems which are always there in profusion.&#x2019;&#x2019; In that sentence Don Marquis was writing his own obituary notice. After about a lifetime of frightfully difficult literary labor keeping newspapers supplied with copy, he fell exhausted.<br><br>I feel obliged, before going any further, to dispose of one troublesome matter. The reader will have perhaps noticed that I am capitalizing the name Archy and the name Mehitabel. I mention this because the capitalization of Archy is considered the unforgivable sin by a whole raft of old <i>Sun Dial</i> fans who have somehow nursed the illogical idea that because Don Marquis&#x2019;s cockroach was incapable of operating the shift key of a typewriter, nobody else could operate it. This is preposterous. Archy himself wished to be capitalized &#x2013; he was no e. e. cummings. In fact he once flirted with the idea of writing the story of his life all in capital letters, if he could get somebody to lock the shift key for him. Furthermore, I capitalize Archy on the highest authority: wherever in his columns Don Marquis referred to his hero, Archy was capitalized by the boss himself. What higher authority can you ask?<br><br>The device of having a cockroach leave messages in his typewriter in the <i>Sun</i> office was a lucky accident and a happy solution for an acute problem. Marquis did not have the patience to adjust himself easily and comfortably to the rigors of daily columning, and he did not go about it in the steady, conscientious way that (for example) his contemporary Franklin P. Adams did. Consequently Marquis was always hard up for stuff to fill his space. Adams was a great editor, an insatiable proof-reader, a good make-up man. Marquis was none of these. Adams, operating his Conning Tower in the <i>World</i>, moved in the commodious margins of column-and-a-half width and built up a reliable stable of contributors. Marquis, cramped by single-column width, produced his column largely without outside assistance. He never assembled a hard-hitting bunch of contributors and never tried to. He was impatient of hard work and humdrum restrictions, yet expression was the need of his soul. (It is significant that the first words Archy left in his machine were &#x2018;&#x2018;expression is the need of my soul&#x2019;&#x2019;.)<br><br>The creation of Archy, whose communications were in free verse, was part inspiration, part desperation. It enabled Marquis to use short (sometimes very, very short) lines, which fill space rapidly, and at the same time it allowed his spirit to soar while viewing things from the under side, insect fashion. Even Archy&#x2019;s physical limitations (his inability to operate the shift key) relieved Marquis of the toilsome business of capital letters, apostrophes, and quotation marks, those small irritations that slow up all men who are hoping their spirit will soar in time to catch the edition. Typographically, the <i>vers libre</i> did away with the turned or runover line that every single-column practitioner suffers from.<br><br>Archy has endeared himself in a special way to thousands of poets and creators and newspaper slaves, and there are reasons for this beyond the sheer merit of his literary output. The details of his creative life make him blood brother to writing men. He cast himself with all his force upon a key, head downward. So do we all. And when he was through his labors, he fell to the floor, spent. He was vain (so are we all), hungry, saw things from the under side, and was continually bringing up the matter of whether he should be paid for his work. He was bold, disrespectful, possessed of the revolutionary spirit (he organized the Worms Turnverein), was never subservient to the boss yet always trying to wheedle food out of him, always getting right to the heart of the matter. And he was contemptuous of those persons who were absorbed in the mere technical details of his writing. &#x2018;&#x2018;The question is whether the stuff is literature or not.&#x2019;&#x2019; That question dogged his boss, it dogs us all. This book &#x2013; and the fact that it sells steadily and keeps going into new editions &#x2013; supplies the answer.<br><br>In one sense Archy and his racy pal Mehitabel are timeless. In another sense, they belong rather intimately to an era &#x2013; an era in American letters when this century was in its teens and its early twenties, an era before the newspaper column had degenerated. In 1916 to hold a job on a daily paper, a columnist was expected to be something of a scholar and a poet &#x2013; or if not a poet at least to harbor the transmigrated soul of a dead poet. Nowadays, to get a columning job a man need only have the soul of a Peep Tom, or of a third-rate prophet. There are plenty of loud clowns and bad poets at work on papers today, but there are not many columnists adding to belles lettres, and certainly there is no Don Marquis at work on any big daily, or if there is, I haven&#x2019;t encountered his stuff. This seems to me a serious falling off of the press. Mr. Marquis&#x2019;s cockroach was more than the natural issue of a creative and humorous mind. Archy was the child of compulsion, the stern compulsion of journalism. The compulsion is as great today as it ever was, but it is met in a different spirit. Archy used to come back from the golden companionship of the tavern with a poet&#x2019;s report of life as seen from the under side. Today&#x2019;s columnist returns from the platinum companionship of the night club with a dozen pieces of watered gossip and a few bottomless anecdotes. Archy returned carrying a heavy load of wine and dreams. These later cockroaches come sober from their taverns, carrying a basket of fluff. I think newspaper publishers in this decade ought to ask themselves why. What accounts for so great a falling off? <br><br>I hesitate to say anything about humor, hesitate to attempt an interpretation of any man&#x2019;s humor: it is as futile as explaining a spider&#x2019;s web in terms of geometry. Marquis was, and is, to me a very funny man, his product rich and satisfying, full of sad beauty, bawdy adventure, political wisdom, and wild surmise; full of pain and jollity, full of exact and inspired writing. The little dedication to this book<br><br>. . . to babs<br>with babs knows what<br>and babs knows why<br><br>is a characteristic bit of Marquis madness. It has the hasty despair, the quick anguish, of an author who has just tossed another book to a publisher. It has the unmistakable whiff of the tavern, and is free of the pretense and the studied affection that so often pollute a dedicatory message.<br><br>The days of the Sun Dial were, as one gazes back on them, pleasantly preposterous times and Marquis was made for them, or they for him. <i>Vers libre </i>was in vogue, and tons of souped-up prose and other dribble poured from young free-verse artists who were suddenly experiencing a gorgeous release in the disorderly high-sounding tangle of non-metrical lines. Spiritualism had captured people&#x2019;s fancy also. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was in close touch with the hereafter, and received frequent communications from the other side. Ectoplasm swirled around all our heads in those days. (It was great stuff, Archy pointed out, to mend broken furniture with.) Souls, at this period, were being transmigrated in Pythagorean fashion. It was the time of &#x2018;&#x2018;swat the fly,&#x2019;&#x2019; dancing the shimmy, and speakeasies. Marquis imbibed freely of this carnival air, and it all turned up, somehow, in Archy&#x2019;s report. Thanks to Archy, Marquis was able to write rapidly and almost (but not quite) carelessly. In the very act of spoofing free verse, he was enjoying some of its obvious advantages. And he could always let the chips fall where they might, since the burden of responsibility for his sentiments, prejudices, and opinions was neatly shifted to the roach and the cat. It was quite in character for them to write either beautifully or sourly, and Marquis turned it on and off the way an orchestra plays first hot, then sweet.<br><br>Archy and Mehitabel, between the two of them, performed the inestimable service of enabling their boss to be profound without sounding self-important, or even self-conscious. Between them, they were capable of taking any theme the boss threw them, and handling it. The piece called &#x2018;&#x2018;the old trouper&#x2019;&#x2019; is a good example of how smoothly the combination worked. Marquis, a devoted member of The Players, had undoubtedly had a bellyful of the lamentations of aging actors who mourned the passing of the great days of the theater. It is not hard to imagine him hastening from his club on Gramercy Park to his desk in the <i>Sun</i> office and finding, on examining Archy&#x2019;s report, that Mehitabel was inhabiting an old theater trunk with a tom who had given his life to the theater and who felt that actors today don&#x2019;t have it any more &#x2013; &#x2018;&#x2018;they don&#x2019;t have it here.&#x2019;&#x2019; (Paw on breast.) The conversation in the trunk is Marquis in full cry, ribbing his nostalgic old actors all in the most wildly fantastic terms, with the tomcat&#x2019;s grandfather (who trooped with Forrest) dropping from the fly gallery to play the beard. This is double-barreled writing, for the scene is funny in itself, with the disreputable cat and her platonic relationship with an old ham, and the implications are funny, with the author successfully winging a familiar type of bore. Double-barreled writing and, on George Herriman&#x2019;s part, double-barreled illustration. It seems to me Herriman deserves much credit for giving the right form and mien to these willful animals. They possess (as he drew them) the great soul. It would be hard to take Mehitabel if she were either more catlike, or less. She is cat, yet not cat; and Archy&#x2019;s lineaments are unmistakably those of poet and pest.<br><br>Marquis moved easily from one form of composition to another. In this book you will find prose in the guise of bad <i>vers libre</i>, poetry that is truly free verse, and rhymed verse. Whatever fiddle he plucked, he always produced a song. I think he was at his best in a piece like &#x2018;&#x2018;warty bliggens,&#x2019;&#x2019; which has the jewel-like perfection of poetry and contains cosmic reverberations along with high comedy. Beautiful to read, beautiful to think about. But I am making Archy sound awfully dull, I guess. (Why is it that when you praise a poet, or a roach, he begins to sound well worth shunning?)<br><br>When I was helping edit an anthology of American humor some years ago, I recall that although we had no trouble deciding whether to include Don Marquis, we did have quite a time deciding where to work him in. The book had about a dozen sections; something by Marquis seemed to fit almost every one of them. He was parodist, historian, poet, clown, fable writer, satirist, reporter, and teller of tales. He had everything it takes, and more.We could have shut our eyes and dropped him in anywhere.<br><br>At bottom Don Marquis was a poet, and his life followed the precarious pattern of a poet&#x2019;s existence. He danced on bitter nights with Boreas, he ground out copy on drowsy afternoons when he felt no urge to write and in newspaper offices where he didn&#x2019;t want to be. After he had exhausted himself columning, he tried playwriting and made a pot of money (on <i>The Old Soak</i>) and then lost it all on another play (about the Crucifixion). He tried Hollywood and was utterly miserable and angry, and came away with a violent, unprintable poem in his pocket describing the place. In his domestic life he suffered one tragedy after another &#x2013; the death of a young son, the death of his first wife, the death of his daughter, finally the death of his second wife. Then sickness and poverty. All these things happened in the space of a few years. He was never a robust man &#x2013; usually had a puffy, overweight look and a gray complexion. He loved to drink, and was told by doctors that he mustn&#x2019;t. Some of the old tomcats at The Players remember the day when he came downstairs after a month on the wagon, ambled over to the bar, and announced: &#x2018;&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve conquered that god-damn will power of mine. Gimme a double scotch.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>I think the new generation of newspaper readers is missing a lot that we used to have, and I am deeply sensible of what it meant to be a young man when Archy was at the top of his form and when Marquis was discussing the Almost Perfect State in the daily paper. Buying a paper then was quietly exciting, in a way that it has ceased to be.<br><br>Marquis was by temperament a city dweller, and both his little friends were of the city: the cockroach, most common of city bugs; the cat, most indigenous of city mammals. Both, too, were tavern habitu�s, as was their boss. Here were perfect transmigrations of an American soul, this dissolute feline who was a dancer and always the lady, <i>toujours</i> <i>gai</i>, and this troubled insect who was a poet &#x2013; both seeking expression, both vainly trying to reconcile art and life, both finding always that one gets in the way of the other. Their employer, in one of his more sober moods, once put the whole matter in a couple of lines.<br><br><i>My heart has followed all my days<br>Something I cannot name . . .</i><br><br>Such is the lot of poets. Such was Marquis&#x2019;s lot. Such, probably, is the lot even of bad poets. But bad poets can&#x2019;t phrase it so simply.<br><br><i>E.

He lives in Bournemouth, England.<i>Chapter One<br>New York City<br>Ten Years Later</i><br><br>Dr. Nina Wilde took a deep breath as she paused at the door, her reflection gazing pensively back at her in the darkened glass. She was dressed more formally than normal, a rarely worn dark blue trouser suit replacing her casual sweatshirts and cargo pants, shoulder-length auburn hair drawn back more severely than her usual loose ponytail. This was a crucial meeting, and even though she knew everyone involved, she still wanted to make as professional an impression as possible. Satisfied that she looked the part and hadn't accidentally smudged lipstick across her cheeks, she psyched herself up to enter the room, almost unconsciously reaching up to her neck to touch her pendant. Her good-luck charm.<br><br>She'd found the sharp-edged, curved fragment of metal, about two inches long and scoured by the abrasive sands of Morocco, twenty years before while on an expedition with her parents when she was eight. At the time, her head full of tales of Atlantis, she'd believed it to be made of orichalcum, the metal described by Plato as one of the defining features of the lost civilization. Now, looked at with a more critical adult eye, she had come to accept that her father was right, that it was nothing more than discolored bronze, a worthless scrap ignored or discarded by whoever had beaten them to the site. But it was definitely man-made&#x2014;the worn markings on its curved outer edge proved that&#x2014;and since it was her first genuine find, her parents had eventually, after much persuasion of the typical eight-year-old's highly repetitive kind, allowed her to keep it.<br><br>On returning to the United States, her father made it into a pendant for her. She had decided on the spur of the moment that it would bring her good luck. While that had remained unproven&#x2014;her academic successes had been entirely down to her own intelligence and hard work, and certainly no lottery wins had been forthcoming&#x2014;she knew one thing for sure: the one day she had not worn it, accidentally forgetting it in a mad morning rush when staying at a friend's house during her university entrance exams, was the day her parents died.<br><br>Many things about her had changed since then. But one thing that had not was that she never let a day pass without wearing the pendant.<br><br>More consciously, she squeezed it again before letting her hand fall. She needed all the luck she could get today.<br><br>Steeling herself, she opened the door.<br><br>The three professors seated behind the imposing old oak desk looked up as she entered. Professor Hogarth was a portly, affable old man, whose secure tenure and antipathy towards bureaucracy meant he'd been known to approve a funding request simply on the basis of a mildly interesting presentation. Nina hoped hers would be rather more than that.<br><br>On the other hand, even the most enthralling presentation in history, concluded with the unveiling of a live dinosaur and the cure for cancer, would do nothing to gain the support of Professor Rothschild. But since the tight-lipped, misanthropic old woman couldn't stand Nina&#x2014;or any other woman under thirty&#x2014;she'd already dismissed her as a lost cause.<br><br>So that was one "no" and one "maybe." But at least she could rely on the third professor.<br>Jonathan Philby was a family friend. He was also the man who had broken the news to her that her parents were dead.<br><br>Now everything rested on him, as he not only held the deciding vote but was also the head of the department. Win him over and she had her funding.<br><br>Fail, and . . . <br><br>She couldn't allow herself even to think that way.<br><br>"Dr. Wilde," said Philby. "Good afternoon."<br><br>"Good afternoon," she replied with a bright smile. At least Hogarth responded well to it, even if Rothschild could barely contain a scowl.<br>Nina sat on the isolated chair before the panel.<br><br>"Well," Philby said, "we've all had a chance to digest the outline of your proposal. It's quite . . . unusual, I must say. Not exactly an everyday suggestion for this department."<br><br>"Oh, I thought it was most interesting," said Hogarth. "Very well thought out, and quite daring too. It makes a pleasant change to see a little challenge to the usual orthodoxy."<br><br>"I'm afraid I don't share your opinion, Roger," cut in Rothschild in her clipped, sharp voice. "Ms. Wilde"&#x2014;not Dr. Wilde, Nina realized. Miserable old bitch&#x2014;"I was under the impression that your doctorate was in archaeology. Not mythology. And Atlantis is a myth, nothing more."<br><br>"As were Troy, Ubar and the Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram&#x2014;until they were discovered," Nina shot back. Since Rothschild had obviously already made up her mind, she was going to go down fighting.<br><br>Philby nodded. "Then if you'd like to elaborate on your theory?"<br><br>"Of course." Nina connected her travel-worn Apple laptop to the room's projector. The screen sprang to life with a map covering the Mediterranean Sea and part of the Atlantic to the west.<br><br>"Atlantis," she began, "is one of the most enduring legends in history, but those legends all originate from a very small number of sources&#x2014;Plato's dialogues are the best known, of course, but there are references in other ancient cultures to a great power in the Mediterranean region, most notably the stories of the Sea People who attacked and invaded the coastal areas of what are now Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Spain. But most of what we know of Atlantis comes from Plato's Timaeus and Critias."<br><br>"Both of which are undoubtedly fiction," cut in Rothschild.<br><br>"Which brings me to the first part of my theory," Nina said, having anticipated the criticism. "<br><br>Undoubtedly, there are elements of all of Plato's dialogues&#x2014;not just Timaeus and Critias&#x2014;that are fictionalized, to make it easier for him to present his points, in the same way that timelines are condensed and characters combined in modern-day biopics. But Plato wasn't writing his dialogues as fiction. His other works are accepted as -his-torical documents, so why not the two that mention Atlantis?"<br><br>"So you're saying that everything Plato wrote about Atlantis is completely true?" asked Philby.<br><br>"Not quite. I'm saying that he thought it was. But he was told about it by Critias, working from the writings of his grandfather Critias the Elder, who was told about Atlantis as a child by Solon, and he was told about it by Egyptian priests. So what you have is a game of Chinese whispers&#x2014;well, Hellenic whispers, I suppose"&#x2014;Hogarth chuckled at the joke&#x2014;"where there's inevitably going to be distortion of the original message, like making a copy of a copy of a copy. Now, one of the areas where inaccuracies are most likely to have been introduced over time is in terms of measurements. I mean, there's an oddity about Critias, which contains almost all of Plato's detailed descriptions of Atlantis, that is so obvious nobody ever seems to notice it."<br><br>"And what would that be?" Hogarth asked.<br><br>"That all the measurements Plato gives of Atlantis are not only neatly rounded off, but are also in Greek units! For example, he says that the plain on which the Atlantean capital stood was three thousand stadia by two thousand. First, that's one precisely proportioned plain, and second, it's amazingly convenient that it would match a Greek measurement so exactly&#x2014;-especially considering that it came from an Egyptian source!" Nina found it hard to temper her enthusiasm but tried to rein it back to a more professional level. "Even if the Atlantean civilization used something called a stadium, it's unlikely it would have been the same size as the Egyptian one&#x2014;or the larger Greek one."<br><br>Rothschild pursed her lips sourly. "This is all very interesting," she said, in a tone suggesting she thought the exact opposite, "but how does this enable you to find Atlantis? Since you don't know what the actual Atlantean measurements were, and nor does anyone else, I don't see how any of this helps."<br><br>Nina took a long, quiet breath before answering. She knew that what she was about to say was the potential weak spot in her theory; if the three academics staring intently at her didn't accept her reasoning, then it was all over . . . <br><br>"It's actually key to my proposal," she said, with as much confidence as she could muster. "Simply put, if you accept Plato's measurements&#x2014;with one stadium being a hundred and eighty-five meters, or just under six hundred and seven feet&#x2014;then Atlantis was a very large island, at least three hundred and seventy miles long and two hundred and fifty wide. That's larger than England!" She indicated the map on the screen. "There aren't many places for something that size to hide, even underwater."<br><br>"What about Madeira?" asked Hogarth, pointing at the map. The Portuguese island was some four hundred miles off the African coast. "Could that be a location for what was left of the island after it sank?"<br><br>"I considered that at one point. But the topography doesn't support it. In fact, there's nowhere in the eastern Atlantic that the island Plato describes could be located."<br><br>Rothschild snorted triumphantly. Nina gave her as scathing a look as she dared before returning to the map. "But it's this fact that forms the basis of my theory. Plato said that Atlantis was located in the Atlantic, beyond the Pillars of Heracles&#x2014;which we know today as the Straits of Gibraltar, at the entrance to the Mediterranean. He also said that, converted to modern measurements, Atlantis was almost four hundred miles long. Since there's no evidence that would reconcile both those statements, either Atlantis isn't where he said it was . . . or his measurements are wrong."<br><br>Philby nodded silently. Nina still couldn't judge his mood&#x2014;but suddenly got the feeling that he had already made his decision, one way or the other. "So," he said, "where is Atlantis?"<br><br>It was not a question Nina had expected to be asked quite so soon, as she'd planned to reveal the answer with a suitable dramatic flourish at the end of her -pre-sentation. "Uh, it's in the Gulf of Cadiz," she said, a little flustered as she pointed at a spot in the ocean about a hundred miles west of the Straits of Gibraltar. "I think."<br><br>"You think?" sneered Rothschild. "I hope you have more to back up that statement than mere guesswork."<br><br>"If you'll let me explain my reasoning, Professor Rothschild," said Nina with forced politeness, "I'll show you how I reached that conclusion. The central premise of my theory is that Plato was right, and that Atlantis did actually exist. What he got wrong was the measurements."<br><br>"Rather than the location?" asked Hogarth. "You're ruling out any of the modern theories that maintain Atlantis was actually Santorini, off Crete, and the supposed Atlantean civilization was really Minoan?"<br><br>"Definitely. For one thing, the ancient Greeks knew about the Minoans already. Also, the time scales don't match. The volcanic eruption that destroyed Santorini was about nine hundred years before Solon's time, but the fall of Atlantis was nine thousand years before."<br><br>"The 'power of ten' error by Solon has been widely accepted as a way to connect the Minoans with the Atlantis myth," Rothschild pointed out.<br><br>"The Egyptian symbols for one hundred and one thousand are totally different," Nina told her. "You'd have to be blind or a complete idiot to confuse them. Besides, Plato explicitly states in Timaeus that Atlantis was in the Atlantic, not the Mediterranean. Plato was a pretty smart guy; I'm guessing he could tell east from west. I believe that in the process of the story being passed from the Atlanteans themselves to the ancient Egyptians, then from the Egyptian priests of almost nine thousand years later to Solon, then from Solon to Plato over several generations of Critias's family . . . the measurements got messed up."<br><br>Philby raised an eyebrow. "Messed up?"<br><br>"Okay, maybe that's not the most scientific way I could have put it, but it gets the point across. Even though the names were the same&#x2014;feet, stadia and so on&#x2014;the different civilizations used different units of measurement. Each time the story went from one place to another, and the numbers were rounded off, and even exaggerated to show just how incredible this lost civilization really was, the error grew. My assumption here is that whatever unit the Atlanteans used that was translated as a stadium, it was considerably smaller than the Hellenic unit."<br><br>"That's quite an assumption," said Rothschild.<br><br>"I have logical reasoning to back it up," she said. "Critias gives various measurements of Atlantis, but the most important ones relate to the citadel on the island at the center of the Atlantean capital's system of circular canals."<br><br>"The site of the temples of Poseidon and Cleito," noted Philby, rubbing his mustache.<br><br>"Yes. Plato said the island was five stadia in diameter. If we use the Greek system, that's slightly over half a mile wide. Now, if an Atlantean stadium is smaller, it can't be too much smaller, because Critias says there's a lot to fit on to that island. Poseidon's temple was the biggest, a stadium long, but there were other temples as well, palaces, bathhouses . . . That's almost as packed as Manhattan!"<br><br>"So how big&#x2014;or rather, how small&#x2014;did you deduce an Atlantean stadium to be?" Hogarth asked.<br><br>"The smallest I think it could be would be two thirds the size of the Greek unit," explained Nina. "About four hundred feet. That would make the citadel over a third of a mile across, which when you scale down Poseidon's temple as well leaves just about enough room to fit everything in."<br><br>Hogarth made some calculations on a piece of notepaper. "By that measurement, the island would be, let's see . . ."<br><br>Nina instantly did the mathematics in her head. "It would be two hundred and forty miles long, and over a hundred and sixty wide."<br><br>Hogarth scribbled away for a few seconds to reach the same result. "Hmm. That wouldn't just be in the Gulf of Cadiz . . . it would be the Gulf of Cadiz."<br><br>"But you have to take into account the probability of other errors," said Nina. "The three-thousand-by-two-thousand-stadia figure Plato gave for the island's central plain is clearly rounded up. It could have been exaggerated for effect as well, if not by Plato then certainly by the Egyptians, who were trying to impress Solon. I think you have to assume an error factor of at least fifteen percent. Maybe even twenty."<br><br>"Another assumption, Ms. Wilde?" said Rothschild, a malevolent glint in her eyes.<br><br>"Even with a twenty percent margin, the island would still be over a hundred and ninety miles long," added Hogarth.<br><br>"There's still also the possibility of confusion if the figures were converted from a different numerical base . . ." Nina could feel the situation slipping away from her. "I'm not saying that all my figures are correct. That's why I'm here&#x2014;I have a theory that fits the available data, and I want . . . I would like," she corrected, "the opportunity to test that theory."<br><br>"A sonar survey of the entire Gulf of Cadiz would be a rather expensive way of testing it," Rothschild said smugly.</p><h2>Keegan&#39;s Lady</h2><p><p>A poignant tale of hope and healing -- a classic lovestory from a true master of unforgettable, emotionally richromantic fiction, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author.</p><p> Caitlin O'Shannessy's late father left her with many things:a Colorado ranch, enduring memories of pain and sadness, an unshakable mistrust of men ... and an adversary.</p><p>Ace Keegan has returned to No Name, too late to enacta rightful vengeance on his most hated enemy.

At that precise moment, however, I was &#x201c;between assignments&#x201d;&#x2014;Hollywood&#x2019;s euphemism for out of work&#x2014;and I did not, therefore, have to abandon any post.</p><p>The bright side of unemployment is that you cannot be fired.</p><p>It was springtime in Los Angeles and, notwithstanding my still-fresh New York chauvinism, I could not deny the season&#x2019;s sweetness. I resided in a comfy, cozy cottage with a bright yard and plentiful fruit trees. There were birds, possums, raccoons, and skunks. I even liked the skunks. I noodled around in my head with a notion for a novel, but mainly, from my knotty-pine-paneled, north-light study, I stared serenely at the snowcapped San Gabriel Mountains.</p><p>Twice a week Guild members were required to present ourselves at a particular studio&#x2014;my assignment was Paramount&#x2014;and walk the picket line for three hours. I eagerly anticipated each round. It got me out of doors and into the sunshine, caused me ever so slightly to utilize my muscles. Best of all, for the first time in my life I met regularly with other writers.</p><p>Parading with my colleagues up and back before the studio&#x2019;s Bronson Gate, conversation was endless. We talked sports. We talked weather. We talked cars. We talked Watergate.</p><p>Mainly we talked writing; not the profound, penetrating issues regarding beauty and truth but the hard-bitten nuts/bolts considerations, working writers&#x2019; shoptalk: hand-cranked versus electric pencil sharpeners, standard versus legal-size ruled yellow pads, felt-tipped markers versus ballpoint pens, liquid Wite-Out versus cut-rate bulk generic correction fluid available by the half gallon at an office supply outlet on Lake just north of Colorado in Pasadena.</p><p>Spoiled brats that we were, as all writers are and have been since the invention of writing in ancient Sumer five thousand years ago, we inventoried the injustices visited upon us by our oppressors: agents, actors, executives, the pal-of-the-producer hack who had rewritten and wrecked our latest draft, the director who had botched and butchered our otherwise flawless triumph, the literary manager who had refused to take or return our calls, the spouse, offspring, parent, pal, pet, or potted plant who had neglected to pay ample homage to our timeless and eternal genius.</p><p>Walking that line, talking with my fellows, amid all of the showbiz gossip I discovered a startling, liberating precept. I present it here as the first among many essential principles we&#x2019;ll underscore from time to time throughout this volume.</p><p><i>Principle 1: All writers hate to write.</i></p><p>It is not I alone who dreads the blank page, who struggles daily to drag himself to his desk, who dawdles and procrastinates and picks lint from the carpet to avoid applying fingers to keys. Those nasty habits belong, I realized, to all writers.</p><p>Writers love having written, but we hate to write.</p><p>This may appear cynical, but it is simply a statement of observed fact. To sit hour upon hour in an empty room, attempting to fill blank paper&#x2014;or, these days, glowing LCD screens&#x2014;with story, character, and dialogue worthy of the time, attention, and consideration of an audience is as lonely as life gets. Writing, like banging your head against the wall, feels terrific mainly when you stop.</p><p>On the picket line, putting one foot in front of the other along Melrose, turning the corner at Van Ness, we inventoried the clever and elaborate methods by which the lot of us evade our task. One writer described a technique he had developed whereby he gazed blankly from his window at traffic; as soon as the fourteenth car bearing Nebraska plates drove past, he started writing. Another claimed he would put cool, quiet jazz on the stereo in the background, sharpen all his pencils, lay out neat, fresh stacks of heavy-gauge rag-content bond, test his typewriter ribbon, and then, at long last&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;defrost his refrigerator.</p><p>This is not to deny that there are soaring, triumphant moments attendant to writing. Professional screenwriters are paid, after all, for the very same activity that earns civilians reprimand: daydreaming.</p><p>To write, however, is far more than merely to dream.</p><p><i>Principle 2: To write is to play God.</i></p><p>As God created the universe, writers create the universe of our screenplays. If we want it to rain, it rains. If we are weary of rain and covet sunshine, out comes the sun. If we get mad at somebody and want to kill him&#x2014;who has never wanted to kill somebody?&#x2014;a screenwriter kills him. Afterward, should he experience remorse, with the click of a mouse he can bring him back to life.</p><p>After too many decades of auteurism, the alien notion falsely anointing the director as film&#x2019;s first artist, screenwriters are coming into our own, at long last winning the recognition properly due movies&#x2019; authentic prime movers. The writer is film&#x2019;s first artist if for no other reason than that she is just that: first. The vast, sprawling army of artists and craftspeople who gather to make a movie are lost, every one of them, without the writer. The fanciest state-of-the-art cameras, the latest high-tech editing suite, the finest actors, the most highly respected producers, the whole host of paraphernalia required for the production of a film are useless until a writer writes a plan.</p><p>That plan is the screenplay.</p><p>Legendary director Frank Capra was asked in an interview to explain precisely how he achieved in his movies that legendary quality called &#x201c;the Capra touch.&#x201d; In the interview he rambles on about this technique and that one: clues he whispered to the actors, cues offered to the crew, wisdom shared with the editor. Nowhere in the article does he mention the name Robert Riskin, who had merely written all the referenced films.</p><p>The afternoon the interview appeared in the press there arrived at Capra&#x2019;s office a script-size envelope. Inside was a document very closely resembling a screenplay: a front cover, a back cover, and one hundred and ten pages. The cover and pages, however, were all blank. Clipped to the &#x201c;script&#x201d; was a note from Robert Riskin. It read: &#x201c;Dear Frank, put &#x2018;the Capra touch&#x2019; on this!&#x201d;</p><p>Writing, like all creative expression, for all its struggle represents ultimately structured, organized, orchestrated dreaming. That&#x2019;s why writers&#x2019; most basic task&#x2014;before tale, before character and dialogue&#x2014;is to learn how to let ourselves dream in a free yet orderly fashion.</p><p>Can people really be taught how to dream?</p><p>As a screenwriting educator I am frequently asked the twin questions: Can writing be taught at all? Can formal instruction help a writer compete in the film and television industry?</p><p>The second answer first. Yes.</p><p>There is one strategy&#x2014;the only strategy&#x2014;for writers seeking success in film, television, and digital media: good writing. To that end, any support that helps writers structure their narratives, focus their characters, render their dialogue palpable and provocative, any clue that helps writers create screenplays worthy of audiences, ought to help bridge the chasm between amateur and professional.</p><p>Can writers be taught to write well?</p><p>Again, yes.</p><p>Nobody expects an unschooled clarinetist to go into the closet and emerge a professional. No one expects a composer to master musical theory and notation by means of a miraculous religious vision. Even Mozart had a teacher. Likewise, many new painters have mentors, just as experienced painters have prot�g�s.</p><p>Like all creative expression, writing depends not upon talent alone but also discipline. Each is rare all by itself. The two in tandem, however, are exponentially rarer still. Copious talent and paltry discipline will not carry a writer nearly so far as the converse combination. Naturally, no teacher or book can provide talent; at UCLA&#x2019;s Master of Fine Arts program writers are required to supply their own. Neither can writers have inspiration unwillingly thrust upon them; they must discover motivation within themselves. Happily, however, if teachers cannot provide talent, neither can they take talent away. While no book can supply a freeze-dried formula for concocting the perfect screenplay, there are challenges both narrow and broad that can be usefully addressed.</p><p><b>An Overview of the Present Volume</b></p><p>As underscored in chapter 7, &#x201c;Story: Tale Assembly,&#x201d; there is a vast difference between assembling a child&#x2019;s tricycle fresh from the shipping crate and constructing an integrated screen story. Notably, the latter requires a considerable measure of magic.</p><p>There is so much more to screenwriting than knowing how far to indent dialogue. Readers seeking to learn proper screenplay format can turn to chapter 11. Format aside, screenwriting&#x2019;s central challenge remains, as always, finding the writer&#x2019;s unique voice.</p><p>Chapter 13, &#x201c;The Writing Habit,&#x201d; deals with writers&#x2019; attitudes regarding the daily struggle to structure their dreams into coherent dramatic narratives meriting the time, attention, and consideration of audiences.</p><p>And since the movie not produced, the film not released and not viewed by audiences has precisely the same effect as the movie not written in the first place, chapter 17, &#x201c;Script Sales Strategies,&#x201d; addresses issues pertinent to integrating screenplays into the professional community&#x2014;agents, managers, producers, actors, directors, lawyers, the complete cast of craftspeople and collaborators.</p><p>Too often these latter items preoccupy the attention of inexperienced writers. For writers to begin writing from the standpoint of marketing is a self-defeating prophesy. There is no marketing of material that has yet to be written. It&#x2019;s useless for writers to concern themselves about sales before they have something to sell.</p><p><i>Principle 3: Finding an agent is easy; what is hard is writing a screenplay worthy of an agent&#x2019;s representation.</i></p><p>Finally, having fractured screenwriting into shreds and shards and fragments, we need at the same time to remain mindful of &#x201c;the Whole Picture&#x201d;; part 4 of the book puts all those fragments back together again. In the end, screenwriting, notwithstanding its inevitable agonies, and for all its loneliness, is seen also to be a most delicious addiction.</p><p><i>Principle 4: Writing is schizophrenic.</i></p><p>Writing requires its practitioners temporarily to shatter themselves into a widely varying cast of characters, each possessing unique traits. They need also simultaneously to accomplish assorted sets of tasks that endlessly contradict one another.</p><p>They must deal with seemingly separate items&#x2014;story, character, dialogue, and so many others&#x2014;that are not separate at all but exist only in combination with one another. Writers must wander freely among scattered, chaotic details even as their narratives proclaim a clear, logical, inevitable order. They must write films that are fantastic even as they are plausible. Like all artists, even as they lie through their teeth they must tell nothing but the truth.</p><p><i>Principle 5: Art is the lie that tells the bigger truth.</i></p><p>Chaim Potok, in his timeless novel <i>The Chosen</i>, describes a rabbi in conversation with his son. The Hebrew word for God, the rabbi explains, is <i>mel</i>, which means also &#x201c;king&#x201d; and &#x201c;head.&#x201d; The reverse, <i>lem</i>, means precisely the opposite: &#x201c;fool.&#x201d; <i>Lem</i> also has another meaning: &#x201c;heart.&#x201d;</p><p>If you want to live as a king, the rabbi advises, if you want to emulate God, you must be ruled not by the heart but the head. That is sage advice for a rabbi&#x2019;s son, but not for a writer.</p><p>Writing is a heart-oriented enterprise, more a creation of hands, of belly, of groin, than of intellect. Writing for the screen is from top to bottom a wondrously silly endeavor, a sweetly ridiculous way for grown women and men to ply their trade and live their lives.</p><p>If you want to be God or a king, therefore, let your head guide you. Should you wish to write for the screen, however, live by your heart: Seize the courage to be something of a fool.</p><p><b>PART I</b></p><p>Art</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>Seven Naughty Words</p><p>As longtime Screenwriting chairman and cochairman of UCLA&#x2019;s Department of Film, Television and Digital Media I possess the authority to compel legions of students to purchase screenwriting books.

It has been the subject of fawning media profiles, an exhibit in the Smithsonian, and is beloved by tech billionaires and boho counterculturalists alike. But why does it matter? What does it actually have to offer us? The answer, Caveat Magister writes, is simple: Burning Man's philosophy can help us build better communities in which individuals' freedom to follow their own authentic passions also brings them together in common purpose. Burning Man is a prototype, and its philosophy is a how-to manual for better communities, that, instead of rules, offers principles. Featuring iconic and impossible stories from "the playa," interviews with Burning Man's founders and staff, and personal recollections of the late Larry Harvey--Burning Man's founder, "Chief Philosophical Officer," and the author's close friend and colleague--<i>The Scene That Became Cities</i> introduces readers to the experience of Burning Man; explains why it grew; posits how it could impact fields as diverse as art, economics, and politics; and makes the ideas behind it accessible, actionable, and useful.</p><p>For the last ten years, Caveat Magister, aka Benjamin Wachs, has been actively writing about Burning Man culture and engaging with Burning Man at the cutting edge of its philosophy, composing over 250 articles about it for the Burning Man website. By 2015, this work had made him, outside of Larry Harvey and his fellow founders, one of the leading interpreters of Burning Man within its own culture. In 2015, Larry Harvey asked Caveat, along with Burning Man&#39;s Director of Education, Stuart Mangrum, to sit on a committee, officially called the &#34;Philosophical Center&#34; of the Burning Man nonprofit.&#x201c;Burning Man&#x2014;the annual event in the Nevada desert that has been described as an experiment in community and art&#x2014;has spawned, if not a philosophy and practice, a worldview and movement.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;This wise and insightful book by Caveat Magister, one of Burning Man founder Larry Harvey&#x2019;s muses, takes us on a sublime and illuminating journey that helps explain why the world needs Burning Man and its Ten Principles more than ever.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Chip Conley, author of <i>PEAK: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Deeply personal yet accessible, <i>The Scene That Became Cities</i> is a first of its kind in the genre of Burning Man literature. The wide-ranging, exemplary discussions thoughtfully cover topics from whether Burning Man truly facilitates individual transformations, to its relevance in the political sphere, to how to translate the principle of radical inclusion, to what Burning Man can offer broader society.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Katherine K.

The thought then was that it would only take a couple of months to complete and a simple cookbook would be produced that would be suitable for young brides. </p><p> The "simple" project took three and a half years to complete. It was an instant success and quickly became the "go to" gift for showers and weddings, eventually for young adults moving into their first apartments and finally for anyone and everyone setting up a kitchen. The cookbook has not only become a collector's item and is desirable for its great recipes and historic value as well as for its sentimental value, but has gone down to be thought of as one of the best Jewish cookbooks ever. </p></p><p><p> Norene Gilletz is the leading author of kosher cookbooks in Canada and the owner of Gourmania Inc. Norene divides her time between work as a freelance food writer, editor, food consultant, cooking teacher and culinary spokesperson. Norene is a Certified Culinary Professional with the International Association of Culinary Professionals and a member of the Women's Culinary Network of Toronto. </p><p>"Few cookbooks achieve the impact and reach of this 49-year-old compilation, now in its seventeenth printing. . . Over the years, the content has morphed. While originally written with little or no calorie control in mind and following Jewish dietary guidelines, later editions also featured chapters on low-cal dishes as well as microwave basics. Its nearly 700 recipes will, almost certainly, satisfy every palate and eating idiosyncrasy. There are no photographs, and recipes are crunched together, often four or more to a page. Helpfully, like dishes are grouped with like (e.g., apple pie-type offerings include crunch pie, tart, and turnovers). Expect past as well as up-to-the-minute trends to be reflected, chopped liver (five ways) and Jell-O desserts along with baked vegetables like cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Each chapter is prefaced by helpful hints (Too salty? Add a potato to absorb); sample menus are provided, especially for the Jewish holidays; and even suggestions for "ill child" activities and birthday parties appear."<br>&#x2014; <i>Booklist</i> about the 17th printing <br></p></p><h2>Thirty-Eight Latin Stories Teacher&#39;s Guide</h2><p>This Teacher&#x2019;s Guide to Thirty-Eight Latin Stories provides a literal translation answer key for all of the stories found in the popular reader.

If God is real, and we are created in God's image, then it makes sense that our minds and bodies would be designed with the perceptive ability to sense and experience God. Scientists are now discovering ways that our bodies are designed to connect with God. Brain research shows that our brain systems are wired to enable us to have spiritual experiences. The spiritual circuits that are used in prayer or worship are also involved in developing compassion for others. Our bodies have actually been created to love God and serve our neighbors. Award-winning journalist Rob Moll chronicles the fascinating ways in which our brains and bodies interact with God and spiritual realities. He reports on neuroscience findings that show how our brains actually change and adapt when engaged in spiritual practices. We live longer, healthier, happier and more fulfilling lives when we cultivate the biological spiritual capacity that puts us in touch with God. God has created&nbsp;our bodies to fulfill the Great Commandment; we are hardwired to commune with God and to have compassion and community with other people. Moll explores the neuroscience of prayer, how liturgy helps us worship, why loving God causes us to love others, and how a life of love and service leads to the abundant life for which we were created.

Card lives in Tennessee with his wife and four children."If Psalm 139 were published as a contemporary book, it might look a lot like Rob Moll's <em>What Your Body Knows About God</em>. Channeling the psalmist's wonder at having been 'woven together in the depths of the earth,' Moll, a CT editor at large, wonders at the marvel of humanity: its dynamic blend of body, mind, soul and spirit. Christians don't worship God, serve their neighbors and connect with other people merely because of external rules; such impulses are inscribed in our DNA. . . . Moll offers realistic and inspiring examples of what it looks like to walk this path, crookedness and all. Anyone who has struggled to pay attention in prayer can resonate with his account of sitting against the wall in his children's bedroom after they are tucked in bed, praying in the quiet darkness, sometimes finding focus, other times wander. The psalmist rejoices 'because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful' (139:14). With smart, tender and authentic prose, <em>What Your Body Knows About God</em> beautifully sings this in a 21st century key." (Jenell Williams Paris, Christianity Today, 5-Star Review, November 2014)<br><br>"In <em>What Your Body Knows About God</em>, Moll leads the reader on a tour through cutting-edge science about brains and bodies, bodies that are not a bit less fearfully and wonderfully made even if little about them remains, as the psalmist said, a 'secret place.' . . . [I]t is revelatory to learn that science emphatically does not suggest that selfishness, social isolation and godlessness define the 'natural' human condition. Mirror neurons and mimicry that happens below the level of consciousness&#x2015;as when you slip into imitating the speech and mannerisms of your conversation partner without realizing it&#x2015;suggest that there's something in us that wants to connect deeply with others." (Rachel Marie Stone, Books Culture, November/December 2014)<br><br>"The Great Commandments and the Great Commission are at the core of our spiritual lives. In this book my friend, Rob Moll, tells a fascinating story of how God wired these commands into our very biology. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to dig deeper into their spiritual life." (Richard Stearns, president, World Vision/US; author of The Hole in Our Gospel and Unfinished)<br><br>"It's always exciting a read to a book whose core insight makes such intuitive sense but whose implications have gone underexplored. Rob Moll's work is engrossing and informative, and you can act on it right away. And at the book's heart is a really encouraging message grounded in solid research: when you look at your body closely, you'll find out that you're designed to be who you really want to be." (Patton Dodd, editor in chief, OnFaith)<br><br>"We have all seen stories and read about recent research that links developments in brain science to religious practice. Rob Moll goes beyond individual studies, merging scientific analysis, biblical teaching, a host of interviews and anecdotal accounts to pen <em>What Your Body Knows About God</em>. In it, Moll draws on the work of neurologists, anthropologists, philosophers, evolutionary and cognitive psychologists, sociologists, and molecular biologists to affirm the orthodox Christian understanding that we are designed to connect with God and others. In the same vein, he effectively demonstrates the power of classic Christian practices to affect change in practitioners, employing scientific discoveries in the field of neuroplasticity, for example, to explain how spiritual disciplines lead to transformation. Moll?s knack for presenting thought-provoking material in an easy-going conversational style makes <em>What Your Body Knows About God</em> a pleasure to read. Further, although replete with scientific information, discussions such as the 'neurological costs' of worship as performance and the transformative benefits of multisensory liturgy leave little doubt that Moll?s concern is practical, not theoretical. As such, it is a must read for pastors, ministers, small group leaders and anyone else concerned with the transformation of people." (Miles S. Mullin II, associate professor of church history, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>"<em>What Your Body Knows About God</em> evokes wonder and worship as Moll skillfully guides the reader through the astonishing complexity of bodies and minds and how human beings relate to one another&#x2015;and to God. A must-read for those curious about spirituality and science, and the relationship between the two." (Rachel Marie Stone, author of Eat With Joy: Redeeming God's Gift of Food)<br><br>"The theologian Henri de Lubac once said that human beings were created with a natural desire for the supernatural. This marvelous, accessible book by Rob Moll picks up on this conviction brilliantly, inviting us to embrace our bodies as the gifts they are. The incarnate God meets us in our bodies and brains. An excellent exposition of the bodily basis of discipleship." (James K. A. Smith, professor of philosophy, Calvin College, author of Imagining the Kingdom: How Worship Works)<br><br>"Body or soul? Brain or spirit? In this carefully researched, engaging book, Rob Moll shows how biblical Christianity brings together the parts of the human we too often divide against each other. Thank God, he has made us for glory that extends to the tips of our toes and even to our neural pathways. Read this and let your whole self rejoice." (Katelyn Beaty, managing editor, Christianity Today magazine)<br><br>"Human biology may have lulled me to sleep in college, but <em>What Your Body Knows About God</em> kept me riveted and up way too late as Moll explores the fascinating connections between the physical and spiritual, the material and the mystical. A must read!" (Caryn Rivadeneira, author of Broke; co-host and producer, Midday Connection, Moody Radio)<br><br>"This book goes behind the genetic curtain to show the intricate and exceptional design within our bodies to provide groundbreaking point&#x2015;we're not only called to worship, but beautifully wired to do so." (Brian Orme, editor, Outreach magazine)</p><h2>A Visit to Don Otavio: A Mexican Journey (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>In the mid-1940s, Sybille Bedford set off from Grand Central Station for Mexico, accompanied by her friend E., a hamper of food and drink (Virginia ham, cherries, watercress, a flute of bread, Portuguese ros�), books, a writing board, and paper.&nbsp;Her resulting travelogue captures the violent beauty of the country she visited.&nbsp;<br><br> Bedford doesn&#x2019;t so much describe Mexico as take the reader there&#x2014;in second-class motor buses over thousands of miles, through arid noons and frigid nights, successions of <i>comida corrida</i>, botched excursions to the coast, conversations recorded verbatim, hilarious observations, and fascinating digressions into murky histories. At the heart of the book is the Don Otavio of the title, the travelers&#x2019; gracious host, his garrulous family and friends, and his Edenic hacienda at Lake Chapala. Published in 1953, <i>A Visit to Don Otavio </i>was an immediate success, &#x201c;a travel book written by a novelist,&#x201d; as Bedford described it, establishing her reputation as a nonpareil writer.</p><p><b>Sybille Bedford</b> (1911&#x2013;2006) was born Sybille von Schoenebeck in Charlottenburg, Germany, to an aristocratic German father and a partly Jewish, Hamburg-born mother. Raised variously in Germany, Italy, France, and England, she lived with her mother and Italian stepfather after her father&#x2019;s death when she was seven, and was educated privately. En�cour�aged by Aldous Huxley, Bedford began writing fiction at the age of sixteen and went on to publish four novels, all influenced by her itinerant childhood among the European aristocracy:&nbsp;<i> A Legacy</i> (an NYRB Classic),&nbsp; <i>Jigsaw</i> (short-listed for the 1989 Booker Prize), and <i>A Favourite of the Gods</i> and <i>A</i>&nbsp;<i>Compass Error</i> (forthcoming from NYRB in a single volume in 2017). She married Walter Bedford in 1935 and lived briefly in America during World War II, before returning to England. She was a prolific travel writer, the author of a two-volume biography of her friend Huxley, and a legal journalist, covering nearly one hundred trials. In 1981 she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.<br><br> <b>Bruce Chatwin </b>(1940&#x2013;1989) was born in Sheffield, England. He was appointed a director of Sotheby&#x2019;s at age twenty-five, but left to study archaeology at the University of Edinburgh and soon began a career as a travel writer for <i>The Sunday Times Magazine</i>. His 1977 book <i>In Patagonia</i> is considered a classic in the field of travel writing, and his 1988 novel, <i>Utz</i>, was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize."Bedford treats many aspects of Mexican culture and daily life with humor and grace: the slow passing of time, religious and civil fiestas...siestas and gunfights, bejeweled women an their sinful secrets, the music...and political gossip.&#x201d; &#x2014;Enrique Krauze, <i>The New York Review of Books&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Bedford is a beloved writer, and this travel memoir, originally published in 1953, brings all the same brilliance...Her impromptu trip is narrated in such amazing detail that you&#x2019;ll delay the end, hoping the adventure will go on and on.&#x201d; &#x2014;Claire Luchette<i>, Travel + Leisure</i>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Before I am ready to call it quits, I would like to reread every book I ever deeply enjoyed, beginning with Jane Austen and Isaac Babel and Sybille Bedford&#x2019;s <i>A Visit to Don Otavio</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;William Maxwell<br><br> &#x201c;A powerful response to landscape and to people.

Far from rendering the text chaotic, it thrives on these contrasting dimensions, engaging the reader on multiple levels and conveying the full range of Bedford&#x2019;s many talents.

This autobiographical account of the war, the author's first extended prose work, demonstrates Ehrhart's abilities as a writer of prose as well. Vietnam&#x2013;Perkasie is grim, comical, disturbing, and accurate.

But when her mother has a heart attack, she returns home&#x2014;to the Tennessee mountains, where her father is a country doctor and her mother works as his receptionist. Jourdan offers to fill in for her mother until she gets better. But days turn into weeks as she trades her suits for scrubs and finds herself following hazmat regulations for cleaning up bodily fluids; maintaining composure when confronted with a splinter the size of a steak knife; and tending to the loquacious Miss Hiawatha, whose daily doctor visits are never billed. Most important, though, she comes to understand what her caring and patient father means to her close-knit community. With great humor and great tenderness, Heart in the Right Place shows that some of our biggest heroes are the ones living right beside us.</p><p>"This is a wonderful book.

She'd fill in for a few days as the receptionist until her mother could return to work. Or so she thought. But days turned into weeks. <br> Her job "now" included following hazmat regulations for cleaning up bodily fluids; maintaining composure when confronted with a splinter the size of a steak knife; distinguishing between a " pain, " a " strain, " and a " sprain" on indecipherable Medicare forms; and tending to the loquacious Miss Hiawatha, whose daily doctor visits were never billed. <br> Eventually, Jourdan gave up her Mercedes and made do with a twenty-year-old postal jeep. She shed her suits for scrubs. And the funny thing was, she liked her new life. As she watched her father work tirelessly and uncomplainingly, she saw what making a difference really meant: being on call all hours of the day and night, tolerating the local drug addict's frequent phone calls, truly listening to Miss Hiawatha. It meant just showing up, every day, and taking care of every person in Strawberry Plains and beyond, whether he got paid to do it or not. And for his daughter, it meant learning that her real place to change the world was right here-- in her hometown-- by her father's side.</p><h2>Harry Lorayne&#39;s Page-a-Minute Memory Book</h2><p>If time is money, then memory is the bank and Harry Lorayne will show you how to make every minute count, dramatically increasing performance, productivity, and profits.<br>-- Enhance your powers of concentration and observation.<br>-- Double or even triple your daily work output, eliminate careless errors, quickly skim and retain business reports, news articles, and technical data.<br>-- Breeze through exams, improve your grades and classroom performance, reduce your homework time, and increase your free time.<br>-- Give speeches without notes and without anxiety, learn foreign languages more easily, excel at poker, bridge, and other games.<br>-- Heighten your mental agility, learning power, and conversational skills.<br>-- Discover the newfound authority, confidence, and pleasure that come from a quick, sharp, active mind.<br><br>Whatever your lifestyle or walk of life, begin your countdown to success today, and put a world of knowledge and know-how at your fingertips</p><p>.<p>"Ingenious."</p><p>-- The New York Times</p><p>"There Is Little Doubt You Will Find It Rewarding."</p><p>-- Reader's Digest</p><b>Harry Lorayne</b>&nbsp;is the world's foremost memory training specialist and the author of ten bestselling books, including <i>The Memory Book</i>, coauthored with Jerry Lucas.</p><h2>Helen of Pasadena</h2><p>Helen Fairchild is leading a privileged Pasadena existence: married to a pillar of the community; raising a water polo-playing son destined for the most select high school; volunteering her time on the most fashionable committees.

The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama</h2><p><p><strong><em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>One of the <em>Washington Post</em>'s 10 Best Books of 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>Rising Star</em> is the definitive account of Barack Obama's formative years that made him the man who became the forty-fourth president of the United States</strong>&#x2014;<strong>from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>Bearing the Cross</em></strong></p><p>Barack Obama's speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention instantly catapulted him into the national spotlight and led to his election four years later as America's first African-American president.

But don&#x2019;t miss its profound ambition, which is to show how philosophy unearths the structure of ordinary language, defines the meaning of life in routine business, and poses the question of how best to live.&#x201d; &#x2014;Aaron James, author of&nbsp;<i>Assholes: A Theory</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> We all know people who are awesome and people who suck, but what do we really mean by these terms? Have you ever been chill or game? Do you rock or rule? If so, then you&#x2019;re tapped into the ethics of awesomeness. Awesome people excel at creating social openings that encourage expressions of individuality and create community. And if you&#x2019;re a cheapskate, self-promoter, killjoy, or douchebag, you&#x2019;re the type of person who shuts social openings down. Put more simply: You suck.<br> &nbsp;<br> From street art to folk singers, Proust to the great etiquette writer Emily Post, President Obama to former Los Angeles Dodger Glenn Burke,&nbsp;Riggle draws on pop culture, politics, history, and sports to explore the origins of awesome, and delves into the nuances of what it means to suck and why it&#x2019;s so important to strive for awesomeness. An accessible and entertaining lens for navigating the ethics of our time,&nbsp;<i>On Being Awesome</i>&nbsp;provides a new and inspiring framework for understanding ourselves and creating meaningful connections in our everyday lives.</p><p><b>Nick Riggle</b> dropped out of high school to become a pro-skater, participating in stunt shows, demos, and world class competitions (including three ESPN X Games appearances). He has a BA in philosophy from UC Berkeley and a Ph.D. from NYU, America's leading philosophy program; he is currently a philosophy professor at the University of San Diego. He speaks widely at conferences and workshops and co-organized the first major academic conference on the philosophy of street art and graffiti. He continues to publish in key and notable philosophy journals, as well as more popular outlets including <i>McSweeney's</i>, <i>Aeon</i> (on the high five, awesomeness and suckiness), and <i>Hyperallergic</i>. His current academic work focuses on the role of aesthetic value in human life and is supported by a grant from The Experience Project, a 4.8 million dollar, three-year initiative at UNC Chapel Hill and the University of Notre Dame.&#x201c;What is the opposite of an asshole?&nbsp; It&#x2019;s the &#x2018;awesome&#x2019; person who goes off script in the usual interactions, creating new opportunities for creative expression and social communion. Nick Riggle&#x2019;s fun book is &#x2018;awesome&#x2019; by its own definition. But don&#x2019;t miss its profound ambition, which is to show how philosophy unearths the structure of ordinary language, defines the meaning of life in routine business, and poses the question of how best to live.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Aaron James, author of&nbsp;<i>Assholes: A Theory</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s...hard to imagine that anyone else has thought so deeply about the nature of awesomeness: its meaning, its importance, and the ways that true awesomeness is under threat. In <i>On Being Awesome</i>, Riggle offers a careful dissection of the psycho-philosophical categories of sucking...but the book also works as a practical, and surprisingly inspiring, guide to better living.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Scientific American Mind&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A deceptively fun-loving tour of philosophy&#x2019;s most ancient question: how best to live.

It does the good work of taking the vernacular seriously, and makes gamesome use of analytic philosophy&#x2019;s central tools to have a little fun. It would make for a great introduction to analytic philosophy for young people, and place to start thinking about what it means to be good citizens of their social worlds. It also stands as a good reminder to those of us who have been at it for a while that we could probably stand to loosen up a little.&#x201d;<br><b><i>&#x2014;The&nbsp;Journal of&nbsp;Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i><br></b><br>&#x201c;Nick Riggle quickly&nbsp;and convincingly makes the case for the pursuit of&nbsp;awesomeness (and the avoidance of suckiness, its&nbsp;mortal enemy) as a legitimate social aim. . . . In a pluralistic world that fractures further by the&nbsp;minute, being awesome might be the only viable&nbsp;model for the future of our society.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Flood </i>Magazine</b><br><br>&#x201c;Riggle&#x2019;s book is a welcome addition to&nbsp;the trend of philosophy pitched to the public.&nbsp;Like Aaron James&#x2019;s <i>Assholes: A Theory</i>&nbsp;and Harry Frankfurt&#x2019;s <i>On Bullshit</i>, Riggle&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>On Being Awesome</i> shows the promise of employing&nbsp;the tools of analytic philosophy to&nbsp;address the nuances of contemporary culture.&nbsp;The book on the whole is written in&nbsp;a clear, vernacular style that&#x2019;s accessible to&nbsp;a general audience, but at the same time it&nbsp;doesn&#x2019;t pull its philosophical punches. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;also loaded with thought-provoking examples&nbsp;drawn from pop culture, civic life,&nbsp;sports, and the arts.&nbsp;More significantly, Riggle aims to craft&nbsp;the very sort of social opening that his book&nbsp;describes. In creating a rich theory of awesomeness,&nbsp;Riggle invites us to play along&nbsp;by adopting his lingo . . . but more importantly by looking&nbsp;at our lives as opportunities to do awesome&nbsp;things. The only question that remains is&nbsp;whether, you, the reader, are down. In short,&nbsp;it&#x2019;s an awesome book&#x2014;and, upon reading it,&nbsp;you&#x2019;ll know exactly what that means.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>The Philosphers&#x2019; Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Want to bring a little awesomeness into your life?

As Fatal Revenant begins, Linden watches from the battlements of Revelstone while the impossible happens?riding ahead of the hordes attacking Revelstone are Jeremiah and Covenant himself, apparently very much alive. But Covenant is strangely changed?</p><p>Stephen R. Donaldson is the author of six previous Covenant books: <b>Lord Foul's Bane</b>, <b>The Illearth War</b>, <b>The Power That Preserves</b>, <b>The Wounded Land</b>, <b>The One Tree</b>, and <b>White Gold Wielder</b>, as well as many other novels.<p><i>Part One</i></p><p>&#x201c;lest you prove unable to serve me&#x201d;</p><p>1.</p><p><i>Reunion</i></p><p>In sunshine as vivid as revelation, Linden Avery knelt on the stone of a low-walled coign like a balcony high in the outward face of Revelstone&#x2019;s watchtower.</p><p>Implacable as the Masters, Stave of the <i>Haruchai</i> stood beside her: he had led her here in spite of the violence with which his kinsmen had spurned him. And at the wall, the young Stonedownor, Liand, stared his surprised concern and incomprehension down at the riders fleeing before the onrush of the Demondim. Like Stave, if by design rather than by blows, he had abandoned his entire life for Linden&#x2019;s sake; but unlike the former Master, he could not guess who rode with the <i>Haruchai</i> far below him. He could only gaze urgently at the struggling horses, and at the leashed seethe of theurgy among the monsters, and gape questions for which he seemed to have no words or no voice.</p><p>At that moment, however, neither Liand nor Stave impinged on Linden&#x2019;s awareness. They were not real to her.</p><p>Near Liand, Manethrall Mahrtiir studied the exhausted mounts with Ramen concentration while his devoted Cords, Bhapa and Pahni, protected mad, blind Anele from the danger of a fall that he could not see.</p><p>With Linden, they had crossed hundreds of leagues&#x2014;and many hundreds of years&#x2014;to come to this place at this time. In her name, they had defied the repudiation of the Masters who ruled over the Land.</p><p>But none of her companions existed for her.</p><p>To the north lay the new fields which would feed Revelstone&#x2019;s inhabitants. To the south, the foothills of the Keep&#x2019;s promontory tumbled toward the White River. And from the southeast came clamoring the mass of the Demondim, vicious as a host of doom. The monsters appeared to melt and solidify from place to place as they pursued their prey: four horses at the limits of their strength, bearing six riders.</p><p>Six riders. But four of them were Masters; and for Linden, they also did not exist. She saw only the others.</p><p>In the instant that she recognized Thomas Covenant and Jeremiah, the meaning of her entire life changed. Everything that she had known and understood and assumed was altered, rendering empty or unnecessary or foolish her original flight from the Masters, her time among the Ramen, her participation in the horserite of the Ranyhyn. Even her precipitous venture into the Land&#x2019;s past in order to retrieve her Staff of Law no longer held any significance.</p><p>Thomas Covenant was alive: the only man whom she had ever loved.</p><p>Her son was free. Somehow he had eluded Lord Foul&#x2019;s cruel grasp.</p><p>And Jeremiah&#x2019;s mind had been restored. His eager encouragement of the Masters and their mounts as they struggled to outrun the horde showed clearly that he had found his way out of his mental prison; or had been rescued&#x2014;</p><p>Transfixed, she stared at them past the wall of her vantage point, leaping toward them with her gaze and her health-sense and her starved soul. Moments ago, she had seen only the ruinous advance of the Demondim. But now she was on her knees, struck down by the miraculous sight of her adopted son and her dead lover rushing toward Revelstone for their lives.</p><p>Already her arms ached to hold them.</p><p>For two or three heartbeats, surely no more than that, she remained kneeling while Liand tried to find his voice, and Stave said nothing, and Mahrtiir murmured tensely to his Cords. Then she snatched up the Staff and surged to her feet. Mute and compelled, she flung herself back into the watchtower, intending to make her way down to the open gates; to greet Jeremiah and Covenant with her embrace and her straining heart.</p><p>But the chambers within the tower were crowded with tall mounds of firewood and tubs of oil. At first, she could not locate a stairway. And when she discovered the descent, the Masters refused to let her pass. One of them stood on the stair to forbid her.</p><p>&#x201c;We prepare for battle,&#x201d; he informed her curtly. His people had already refused her claims on them. &#x201c;You will be endangered here.&#x201d;</p><p>He did not add, And you will impede our efforts. Nor did she pause to heed him, or to contest the stair. <i>Linden, find me.</i> Her need for haste was too great. In all of her years with her son, she had never seen him react to people and events around him; had never seen an expression of any kind on his slack features. Riding toward Revelstone, however, his face shone with excitement as he waved his arms, urging his companions forward.</p><p>She wheeled away from the stair; ran for the suspended wooden bridge which linked the tower to the battlements of Revelstone.</p><p>Stave came to guide her. He had not wiped the blood from his mouth and chin. Dark stains marked his tunic. But his hurts did not slow him. And Mahrtiir accompanied him, with Bhapa, Pahni, and Liand grouped around Anele at his back.</p><p>They were her friends, but she hardly noticed them.</p><p>Fearless with urgency, she followed Stave and Mahrtiir across the unsteady span above the courtyard between the watchtower and Revelstone&#x2019;s inner gates. Gripping the Staff hard in one hand, she pursued her guides into the sudden gloom of the Keep&#x2019;s lightless passages.</p><p>She did not know the way. She had spent too little time here to learn even a few of Revelstone&#x2019;s complex intersections and halls. And she required illumination. If she had been willing to move more slowly, using only her enhanced senses, she could have trailed Stave&#x2019;s hard shape and Mahrtiir&#x2019;s more legible tension through the wrought gutrock. But she had to <i>hurry.</i> Instinctively, irrationally, she felt that her own rush to meet them might enable Jeremiah and Covenant to reach the comparative safety of the massive interlocking gates, the friable sanctuary of the Masters. As the reflected sunshine behind her faded, and the darkness ahead deepened, she called up a gush of flame from one iron heel of the Staff. That warm light, as soft and clean as cornflowers, allowed her to press Stave and the Manethrall to quicken their pace.</p><p>Nearly running, they descended stairways apparently at random, some broad and straight enough to accommodate throngs, others narrow spirals delving downward. Her need for haste was a fever. Surely she could reach the cavernous hall within the gates ahead of Jeremiah and Covenant and their small band of Masters?</p><p>Her friends followed close behind her. Anele was old; but his intimacy with stone, and his decades among the mountains, made him sure-footed: he did not slow Liand and the Cords. And after them came the three Humbled, Galt, Clyme, and Branl, maimed icons of the Masters&#x2019; commitments. They were as stubborn and unreadable as Stave; but Linden did not doubt that they intended to protect her&#x2014;or to protect against her. The Masters had rejected Stave because he had declared himself her ally; her friend. Naturally they would not now trust him to fill any of their self-assigned roles.</p><p>Fervidly she tried to cast her health-sense farther, striving to penetrate Revelstone&#x2019;s ancient rock so that she might catch some impression of the Vile-spawn. How near had they come? Had they overtaken Covenant and Jeremiah? But she could not concentrate while she dashed and twisted down the passages. She could only chase after Stave and Mahrtiir, and fear that her loved ones had already fallen beneath the breaking tsunami of the Demondim.</p><p>But they had not, she insisted to herself. They had <i>not.</i> The Demondim had withdrawn their siege the previous day for a reason. Possessed by some fierce and fiery being, Anele had confronted the Vile-spawn; and they had responded by allowing Linden and those with her to escape&#x2014;and then by appearing to abandon their purpose against Lord&#x2019;s Keep. Why had they acted thus, if not so that Jeremiah and Covenant might reach her? If they desired Jeremiah&#x2019;s death, and Covenant&#x2019;s, they could have simply awaited their prey in front of Revelstone&#x2019;s gates.</p><p>Jeremiah and Covenant were not being hunted: they were being <i>herded.</i></p><p>Why the Demondim&#x2014;and Anele&#x2019;s possessor&#x2014;might wish her loved ones to reach her alive, she could not imagine. But she strove to believe that Covenant and Jeremiah would not fall. The alternatives were too terrible to be endured.</p><p>Then Linden saw a different light ahead of her: it spilled from the courtyard into the Keep. A moment later, Stave and Mahrtiir led her down the last stairs to the huge forehall. Now she did not need the Staff&#x2019;s flame; but she kept it burning nonetheless. She might require its power in other ways.</p><p>The time-burnished stone echoed her boot heels as she ran into the broad hall and cast her gaze past the gates toward the courtyard and the passage under the watchtower.</p><p>Beyond the sunshine in the courtyard, the shrouded gloom and angle of the wide tunnel obscured her line of sight. She felt rather than saw the open outer gates, the slope beyond them. With her health-sense, she descried as if they were framed in stone the four Masters astride their laboring horses. Covenant clung to the back of one of the <i>Haruchai.</i> Jeremiah balanced precariously behind another.</p><p>The mustang that bore her son was limping badly: it could not keep pace with the other beasts. And Covenant&#x2019;s mount staggered on the verge of foundering. All of the horses were exhausted. Even at this distance, Linden sensed that only their terror kept them up and running. Yet somehow they remained ahead of the swarming Demondim. If the monsters did not strike out with the might of the Illearth Stone, the riders would reach the outer gates well before their pursuers.</p><p>The fact that the Vile-spawn had not already made use of the Stone seemed to confirm Linden&#x2019;s clenched belief that Jeremiah and Covenant were being herded rather than hunted.</p><p>She wanted to cry out her own encouragement and desperation; wanted to demand why the Masters had not organized a sally to defend her loved ones; wanted to oppose the horde with Law and Earthpower in spite of the distance. But she bit down on her lip to silence her panic. Jeremiah and Covenant would not hear her. The <i>Haruchai</i> could not combat the Demondim effectively. And she did not trust herself to wield power when the people whom she yearned to save were between her and the horde.</p><p>Grimly she forced herself to wait, holding her fire over her head like a beacon, nearly a stone&#x2019;s throw from the courtyard so that the Keep&#x2019;s defenders would have room in which to fight if the monsters could not be prevented from passing the gates.</p><p>Abruptly the Masters and their horses surged between the outer gates into the dark tunnel. Hooves clanged on the worn stone as first Covenant and then Jeremiah fell into shadow.</p><p>A heartbeat later, ponderous as leviathans, the outer gates began to close.</p><p>The heavy stone seemed to move slowly, far too slowly to close out the rapacity of the monsters. Through her fear, however, Linden realized that the Demondim had once again slackened their pace, allowing their foes to escape. She felt the impact as the gates thudded together, shutting out the Vile-spawn, plunging the tunnel into stark blackness.</p><p>Then the riders reached daylight in the courtyard, and she saw that all six of them were safe. She did not know how far they had fled the Demondim; but she recognized at once that none of them had suffered any harm.</p><p>The mounts had not fared so well. Like their riders, the horses were uninjured. But their terror had driven them to extremes which might yet kill them: they had galloped hard and long enough to break their hearts. Yet they did not stop until they had crossed the courtyard and passed between the inner gates. Then, as those gates also began to close, shutting out the last daylight, Jeremiah&#x2019;s mount stumbled to its knees; fell gasping on its side with froth and blood on its muzzle. Jeremiah would have plunged to the stone, but the Master with him caught him and lifted him aside. The horse bearing Covenant endured only a moment longer before it, too, collapsed. But Covenant and his fellow rider were able to leap clear.</p><p>When the inner gates met and sealed like the doors of a tomb, the flame of the Staff was the only light that remained in the forehall.</p><p>The Ramen protested at the condition of the horses; but Linden ignored them. She had already begun to rush forward, avid to clasp her loved ones, when Covenant yelled as if in rage, &#x201c;Hellfire, Linden! <i>Put that damn thing out!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped, gasping as though his vehemence had snatched the air from her lungs. Her power fell from her, and instant darkness burst over her head like a thunderclap.</p><p>Oh, God&#x2014;</p><p><i>Just be wary of me. Remember that I&#x2019;m dead.</i></p><p>If she could have found her voice, or drawn sufficient breath, she might have cried out at the Despiser, You <i>bastard</i>! What have you <i>done</i>?</p></p><h2>Washington, D.C: A Novel (Narratives of Empire).</h2><p>With a New Introduction<br><br><b>Washington, D.C.</b>, is the final installment in Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire,his acclaimed six-volume series of historical novels about the American past. It offers an illuminating portrait of our republic from the time of the New Deal to the McCar-thy era.<br><br>Widely regarded as Vidal's ultimate comment on how the American political system degrades those who participate in it, <b>Washington, D.C.</b> is a stunning tale of corruption and diseased ambitions.

The enormous data sets now routinely encountered in the sciences provide an incentive to develop mathematical techniques and computational algorithms that help synthesize, interpret and give meaning to the data in the context of its scientific setting. A specific aim of this book is to integrate standard scientific computing methods with data analysis. By doing so, it brings together, in a self-consistent fashion, the key ideas from:<br>DT statistics,<br>DT time-frequency analysis, and <br>DT low-dimensional reductions <br>The blend of these ideas provides meaningful insight into the data sets one is faced with in every scientific subject today, including those generated from complex dynamical systems. This is a particularly exciting field and much of the final part of the book is driven by intuitive examples from it, showing how the three areas can be used in combination to give critical insight into the fundamental workings of various problems.<br><br><em>Data-Driven Modeling and Scientific Computation</em> is a survey of practical numerical solution techniques for ordinary and partial differential equations as well as algorithms for data manipulation and analysis.

Ten masterful, complex drawings by Bill Reid and ten tales demonstrate the richness and range of Haida mythology, from bawdy yet profound tales of the trickster Raven to poignant, imagistic narratives of love and its complications in a world where animals speak, dreams come real, and demigods, monsters, and men live side by side.</p><p><strong>Bill Reid</strong>, one of the finest artists to work in the Native American tradition, has numerous books documenting and revering his visual art. He is also the author of <em>Solitary Raven</em>, <em>Out of the Silence</em> and, with Bill Holm, <em>Indian Art of the Northwest Coast: A Dialogue on Craftsmanship and Aesthetics</em>."These are simply the best versions of Indian tales I have read: they are colloquial yet poetic, precise yet spilling outside their boundaries, accumulating and then blending into one another."&#x2015;<i>Canadian Literature</i><p>"The drawings are impressive; the stories are engaging.

At last, there can be a storybook ending...unless, of course, Charlotte's one mad indiscretion had not been with him at all....</p><p>When the young Lady Charlotte Caverstill attends a local masked ball while on holiday in the countryside, she has no intention of dishonoring herself. But a handsome man ignites an unknown passion in her, and she finds herself willingly following him into the shadows of the garden. Before the night is over, Charlotte has surrendered her heart, as well as her virginity, to this man whom she doesn't know.<p> Though Alex McDonough Foakes spends the entire summer trying to track down the mysterious maiden from the masquerade ball, he cannot find her. Sent to Italy, he seeks solace in an ill-fated marriage, and returns years later a father, a widower, and a pessimist in love. When Alex meets Charlotte, he falls madly in love with her--despite his inability to recognize her--and proposes. She refuses. How can she marry a man who does not remember her after such an intimacy? And if she does, how can she explain her lack of virginity?</p><p> In this, her debut novel, author Eloise James takes special care to test and develop her characters in different situations. Unlike books with the familiar cart-before-the-horse plot, James does not restrict her characters to the bedroom; as Charlotte and Alex interact with friends and family in different arenas, they become more realistic and interesting. And though their motives are not always believable, the lovers appear to be a part of a greater world--one that will quickly capture the reader's imagination. <i>--Nancy R.E.

The mysterious Magi from the East were in all likelihood astrologers and counselors from the court of the Nabatean king at Petra, where the Hebrew messianic prophecies were well known.

Inside, Michio Kushi, founder of Macrobiotics in America, points the way toward a long-lasting solution to the problem of cancer. Also included are twelve moving personal stories of cancer victims who overcame illness through macrobiotics.<br> &nbsp;<br> More than thirty-five years ago, Michio Kushi began saying that diet was a principle cause of cancer. He pointed out that a diet based on whole grains, sea and land vegetables, beans, and seasonal fruits could prevent, and in many cases, help reverse the process of cancer. In this edition of <i>The Macrobiotic Approach to Cancer</i>, Mr. Kushi details the macrobiotic diet and lifestyle that has helped thousands of individuals recover from illness and find better health and peace of mind.</p><p>In many ways, cancer is a symbol of the destructive trends that confront us all in the final decade of the twentieth century. The crisis in personal and global health, in which cancer plays a major role, is rapidly approaching a critical stage, and may soon threaten the continuation of society. In order to reverse this destructive trend and avert future catastrophe, we need to change our way of thinking and look beyond partial or symptomatic answers....Central to this new understanding is a respect for the importance of diet. <p> Medical studies and case reports indicate that sea vegetables can be effective in eliminating tumors....A 1986 screening of sea vegetables for antitumor activity found that nine out of the eleven varieties studied inhibited tumors in animals.</p>It is not an exaggeration to call the rise in the incidence of cancer an epidemic, and modern diet and lifestyle seem like two of the more obvious possible culprits. Author Michio Kushi, founder of Macrobiotics in America, reviews what 25 years of scientific research into the links between diet and cancer has taught us, and then proposes some fairly simple, if stringent, dietary goals. Michio suggests general guidelines, rather than specific diets, allowing the reader to understand the principles of macrobiotics, and create a personalized nutritional program. <i>The Macrobiotic Approach to Cancer</i> includes dozens of anecdotal accounts of cancer survivors who benefited from macrobiotics, an inspiration to those of us who have trouble contemplating a life free of sugar and spice and what seems like everything nice. This is not a cookbook; Michio wisely advises that you take a class in macrobiotic cooking if you decide to adopt a macrobiotic diet. -- <i>From The WomanSource Catalog &amp; Review: Tools for Connecting the Community for Women; review by Patricia Pettijohn</i></p><h2>The Shadow Throne (The Shadow Campaigns)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;An immensely entertaining novel&#x201d; (Tor.com) from the author of <i>The Thousand Names</i>...</b><br><br>The King of the Vordan is on his deathbed.

The building&#x2014;dubbed &#x201c;the Cobweb&#x201d;&#x2014;was innocuous enough on the outside, another example of Farus VI&#x2019;s fondness for marble, classical columns, and elaborately decorated facades. Inside, the stories ran, it was a place of dust and shadows, full of hidden archives, rat-infested cells, and elaborate death traps. More than one adventure serial had featured some hero rescuing his ladylove from its forgotten oubliettes.</p><p>Duke Mallus Kengire Orlanko, Minister of Information and head of the Concordat, found all of this faintly offensive. In reality the Cobweb was lit by thousands of standing lamps, day and night, and a whole corps of junior servants was employed refilling oil and replacing wicks. There was no point in having the clerks ruin their eyesight trying to squint by candlelight, after all. And if one thought about it logically for a moment, it would be much <i>harder</i> to sneak into a brightly lit building bustling with activity than a moldering dungeon full of death traps. As for cells, there were a few, of course, but they were hardly rat-infested. Orlanko tolerated no vermin in his domain.</p><p>It was yet another example of the popular taste for colorful fantasy over prosaic reality. In Orlanko&#x2019;s opinion, if the Vordanai as a people could be said to have a fault, it was an excess of imagination outweighing proper sense. Not that the duke was complaining. He&#x2019;d become an expert at playing on that imagination over the years.</p><p>His private office, at the top of the building, was a remarkably small and well-organized one. If an outsider had wandered in&#x2014;though of course none were ever allowed to do so&#x2014;he might have wondered where all the books and papers had gotten to. This was, after all, the heart of the Ministry of Information, the nerve center of the Concordat, the omniscient (again, in the popular imagination) secret police who knew everything about everyone. And yet here was the Last Duke himself, sitting behind a modest oak desk with only a few clipped bundles of paper, and not even a bookshelf to decorate the walls or a leather-bound tome full of dark secrets.</p><p>Again, the duke thought, a failure of common sense. What was the point of turning his office into a library? The whole <i>building</i> was his library, and all he really needed to do his business was the little copper bell on his desk. Ringing it would send in a clerk&#x2014;there was always a queue of them waiting outside&#x2014;who would silently accept the Last Duke&#x2019;s instructions and take them down into the archives, deputizing subclerks and sub-subclerks to break his order into manageable tasks. Files would be read, copied, summarized, and collated, until the original clerk returned to Orlanko&#x2019;s desk with another neat clipped bundle of paper. It was a machine for <i>knowing</i> things, for carrying out the will of the man sitting behind the desk, and Orlanko was immensely proud of it. Building it had been his life&#x2019;s work.</p><p>In that sense, Andreas bothered him. Not the man specifically, but the need for him, and others like him. Duke Orlanko wished that everything was like his Ministry, where he could just ring a little bell and speak a few words to set the whole vast apparatus clicking into motion. Beyond the walls of the Cobweb, unfortunately, things were messier, and required the employment of those who, like Andreas, had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. special talents.</p><p>Andreas was in his middle thirties, with an average build and a forgettable face, both assets in his line of work. He wore one of the black, floor-length leather greatcoats that were the unofficial uniform of the Concordat. The coat had become a symbol. Parents frightened their children with it. This was useful, since if everyone knew what a Concordat agent looked like, it made it all the easier <i>not</i> to look like one when that was what was required.</p><p>Orlanko shifted in his special chair, which creaked slightly as hidden springs took up his weight. He adjusted his spectacles and pretended to notice Andreas for the first time, though the man had been waiting patiently for at least a quarter of an hour.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Andreas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any progress with your investigation of the Gray Rose?&#x201d;</p><p>Some things were too delicate to trust to the machine. The Gray Rose had been another of Orlanko&#x2019;s special employees, one of the best, but she&#x2019;d slipped the leash several years back and disappeared without a trace. As a matter of principle, the duke couldn&#x2019;t allow that sort of thing. Andreas had been pursuing her ever since, patiently following the faintest traces with a persistence that would have done credit to a bloodhound. Andreas, the duke sometimes thought, was a bit like an automaton himself.</p><p>&#x201c;I have several promising leads, sir,&#x201d; Andreas said. &#x201c;My people are following them up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still convinced she hasn&#x2019;t left the country?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The balance of evidence seems to suggest she remains in the city, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Damn the woman, Orlanko thought. If she&#x2019;d done the logical thing and fled beyond his supposedly all-powerful reach, he would have happily called off the hunt. She knew nothing that would damage him, not at this stage. But by remaining close by, she implicitly challenged his authority, and that could not be tolerated. It was an irritating waste of resources.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sure your men can proceed without you for a time. There are other matters that require our attention.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Andreas waited patiently, hands crossed behind his back.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard the news from Khandar?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Colonel Vhalnich appears to have won a great victory. The Vermillion Throne is secure, and newly indebted to His Majesty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So the papers would have us believe,&#x201d; Orlanko said sourly. Vhalnich was already well on his way to becoming a popular hero. Such stories were usually exaggerations, but the duke&#x2019;s own agents reported that the broadsheets were, if anything, understating the case. &#x201c;Vhalnich is on his way back here, apparently. He&#x2019;s expected any day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the special asset you sent with him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard nothing.&#x201d; Orlanko&#x2019;s finger tap-tap-tapped on the report. &#x201c;Which, in itself, speaks volumes. If we assume the worst, she&#x2019;s been eliminated.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the Thousand Names may be in Vhalnich&#x2019;s hands.&#x201d; A hint of animation entered Andreas&#x2019; face. &#x201c;Would you like him removed upon arrival?&#x201d;</p><p>The duke stifled a sigh. If Andreas had a fault, it was a definite tendency to resort to drastic measures too quickly. It was an odd failing in someone so patient in every other respect. Orlanko suspected that Andreas simply liked to kill people.</p><p>&#x201c;That would be a bit obvious, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; Orlanko shook his head. &#x201c;No, Vhalnich will undoubtedly enjoy the favor of the king and the adoration of the mob. For the moment, we dare not touch him. But His Majesty is <i>very</i> ill. If he dies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we shall see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We need to know what happened in Khandar, Andreas. If these Names our Elysian friends are so interested in really exist, and whether or not Vhalnich has them. Whether he even understands their importance.&#x201d; He leaned back in his chair, springs creaking. &#x201c;Find out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Understood, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vhalnich is a very clever man, and he&#x2019;ll be on his guard. Concentrate on the people around him. Nothing too obvious, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Andreas betrayed only a hint of disappointment.</p><p>&#x201c;And I may have another assignment for you soon, depending on how the king&#x2019;s health progresses. There are quite a few little cabals out there hoping to capitalize on the confusion. We have them all infiltrated, naturally, and there&#x2019;s nothing <i>terribly</i> dangerous. But a few well-timed disappearances should put the fear of God into them.&#x201d; Or rather, he thought, the fear of the Last Duke. That was better. &#x201c;Make sure your people are ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That will be all.&#x201d;</p><p>Andreas ghosted out. Orlanko looked at the stack of reports, adjusted his glasses, and unclipped the top pile.</p><p>What nobody understood was how <i>hard</i> his job was. Riding herd on the city sometimes felt like trying to keep his seat on an unruly stallion. Yes, he knew about everything of importance practically before it happened, and yes, he could whisper a name and Andreas or someone like him would drag that person into a cell where they&#x2019;d never see the light of day again. But really, what good was that? You couldn&#x2019;t lock <i>everybody</i> up. His task was much trickier&#x2014;to make them forge a prison in their own minds, out of their own fears, in which they would lock themselves and throw away the key. He&#x2019;d been working at it for years, and he liked to think he&#x2019;d done a fair job. The black coats were part of it. The occasional vanishing, the odd body found floating in the river, those just helped to grease the hinges. Fear would populate every shadow with hooded figures, when even he couldn&#x2019;t possibly employ enough agents to do the job.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t afraid of conspiracies. No conspiracy could survive exposure and decapitation, after all, and he was an expert at both. But Orlanko had learned to feel the <i>mood</i> of the city, as though it were a single vast organism. Sometimes it was sleepy and complacent, when times were good and people were fat and happy. When times were lean, it was snappy and irritable, prone to sudden rages and panics. And the death of a king always put people on edge.</p><p>He could feel something coming. The city was like a dog growling deep in its throat, not quite ready to leap but not far from it. It was his job to calm it, with either a nice bloody steak or a well-placed boot. Which it would be, Duke Orlanko had not yet decided.</p><p>But once the king died, after the chaos subsided, he would finally have what he&#x2019;d dreamed of all these years. A ruler who would <i>listen</i>.</p><p><i>She&#x2019;ll listen.</i> Orlanko smiled to himself. <i>Or else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>RAESINIA</p><p>The mirrored halls of the Royal Palace at Ohnlei were dark and quiet.</p><p>Not silent, for the thousands of footmen, maids, gardeners, guards, cook and candle boys who made the great palace run could never really stop moving, any more than a heart could stop pumping. But they moved cautiously, avoiding loud footfalls on the marble floors and talking in low voices, and only a few candles flickered in the enormous braziers. The great black velvet drapes and carpets had not been hung, for the king had not yet died, but in a hundred cellars and storerooms they had been unrolled, aired out, and checked for wear.</p><p>Raesinia and her party clattered through the hush like a wild stallion in a glazier&#x2019;s. First came the princess&#x2019; hard-soled shoes, <i>tak-tak-tak</i>, and then the heavy, flat-footed tromp of the trio of Noreldrai Grays who provided her escort. It gave everyone plenty of warning to form up and clear the way, so that her progress was marked by a bow wave of dipping heads from staff lined up on either side of the corridor. The occasional courtier sparkled like a precious stone among the pale blue of the Royal livery. Ordinarily, politeness would have obliged her to stop and exchange a few pleasant words with anyone of sufficient rank, but under the circumstances the nobles merely bowed their heads and let her by. No doubt they began whispering as soon as she turned the corner, but Raesinia was used to that.</p><p>The ground-floor apartments of the king were reached through a broad marble arch, carved with a frieze depicting King Farus VI in the act of smiting some armored foe. Raesinia&#x2019;s great-grandfather was everywhere at Ohnlei. He&#x2019;d died decades before she was born, but she&#x2019;d seen his narrow-cheeked, pointy-bearded countenance on so many statues, bas-reliefs, and portraits that he was as familiar to her as any of her living family. This one was actually not a particularly good likeness, she&#x2019;d always suspected. The sculptor had given the king a squint, and he looked out at the viewer rather than keeping his eyes on the business at hand, as though to say, &#x201c;Who are you, and what are you doing at my battle?&#x201d;</p><p>Beyond the arch was a grassy courtyard, roofed over with great sliding panes of glass that could be opened to let the air in when the weather was good. Here the king, in better days, would receive guests or dine with his favorites. It was surrounded by a colonnade and a terrace floored with marble, from which a dozen oak-and-gilt doors led to the king&#x2019;s private chambers and the residences of his servants and guards. A dozen of the latter were scattered around the courtyard, not just the somber-uniformed Noreldrai Grays but Armsmen in their forest green coats and white trousers and Royal Army grenadiers in Vordanai blue and polished brass. Guarding the king was a great honor, and none of the three services was willing to leave it to the others.</p><p>In the middle of the lawn, looking a bit incongruous, was a polished oak dining table surrounded by high-backed chairs. Raesinia had eaten there many times with her father, in the company of the mightiest nobles of the land, surrounded by a veritable swarm of servants and flunkies. Now the long, mirror-smooth surface was nearly empty. At the far end sat a gray-haired man, back hunched from a lifetime of bending over the beds of his patients. He got painfully to his feet as Raesinia approached, in spite of her urgent gesture.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Your Highness,&#x201d; he said, with as much of a bow as his stiff back could muster. &#x201c;I hope you are well?&#x201d;</p><p>He had a Hamveltai accent, which turned &#x201c;well&#x201d; into &#x201c;vell.&#x201d; Raesinia nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;As well as ever, Doctor-Professor Indergast,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He peered at her over the top of thin-rimmed half-moon spectacles. &#x201c;I ought to have a look at your diet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Some days it seems to me that you are not growing up properly. Your mother was nearly as tall as I when she was nineteen, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Raesinia, who had to look up slightly to meet the stoop-shouldered doctor&#x2019;s gaze, gave a careful shrug. &#x201c;Perhaps, someday. But we have more important things to worry about at the moment. I got a message to come at once&#x2014;is he all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His condition has not changed, Your Highness,&#x201d; Indergast said. &#x201c;I am sorry to have worried you. It is only that he is awake, and asked to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>Raesinia&#x2019;s heart gave a weak flop. Her father slept more than he was awake, these days, and sometimes he was delirious with pain and fever. She&#x2019;d spent many hours at his bedside, holding his hand, but he hadn&#x2019;t often known she was there.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better go and see him, then,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;before he falls asleep again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, Your Highness. Pay no mind to me.&#x201d; He gestured at a huge book, which lay open on the table where he&#x2019;d been sitting. &#x201c;I was only paging through a volume of Acheleos that the Grand Bishop was kind enough to lend me, to see if he had anything useful to tell us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And does he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Alas, no. Like all the ancients, he has many theories but very little practical advice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll figure something out. You always have.&#x201d;</p><p>Doctor-Professor Indergast ran one gnarled hand through his wispy hair. He had been personal physician to her father since before Rae...</p></p><h2>The Complete Saki (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p><b>The complete works of one of England's greatest Edwardian writers</b><br><br>Saki is perhaps the most graceful spokesman for England's 'Golden Afternoon' - the slow and peaceful years before the First World War. Although, like so many of his generation, he died tragically young, in action on the Western Front, his reputation as a writer continued to grow long after his death. His work is humorous, satiric, supernatural, and macabre, highly individual, full of eccentric wit and unconventional situations. With his great gift as a social satirist of his contemporary upper-class Edwardian world, Saki is one of the few undisputed English masters of the short story and one of the great writers of a bygone era.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>H.H. Munro,</b> also known by his pseudonym Saki (1870-1916), was a prolific Scottish author of the Edwardian era. He wrote <i>The Chronicles of Clovis</i>, <i>When William Came: A Story of London Under the Hohenzollerns</i>, and <i>Complete Stories and Novels Of Saki</i>. At age 44, Munro volunteered as a soldier during World War I, enlisting in the 22nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers. He wrote a number of short stories from the trenches.</p><h2>The Art of Procrastination: A Guide to Effective Dawdling, Lollygagging and Postponing</h2><p>This is not a book for Bill Gates. Or Hillary Clinton, or Steven Spielberg. Clearly they have no trouble getting stuff done. For the great majority of us, though, what a comfort to discover that we&#x2019;re not wastrels and slackers, but doers . . . in our own way. It may sound counterintuitive, but according to philosopher John Perry, you can accomplish a lot by putting things off. He calls it &#x201c;structured procrastination&#x201d;:<br><i><br>In 1995, while not working on some project I should have been working on, I began to feel rotten about myself. But then I noticed something. On the whole, I had a reputation as a person who got a lot done and made a reasonable contribution. . . . A paradox. Rather than getting to work on my important projects, I began to think about this conundrum. I realized that<br>I was what I call a structured procrastinator: a person who gets a lot done by not doing other things.</i><br><br>Celebrating a nearly universal character flaw, <i>The Art of Procrastination</i> is a wise, charming, compulsively readable book&#x2014;really, a tongue-in-cheek argument of ideas. Perry offers ingenious strategies, like the defensive to-do list (&#x201c;1. Learn Chinese . . .&#x201d;) and task triage. He discusses the double-edged relationship between the computer and procrastination&#x2014;on the one hand, it allows the procrastinator to fire off a letter or paper at the last possible minute; on the other, it&#x2019;s a dangerous time suck (Perry counters this by never surfing until he&#x2019;s already hungry for lunch). Or what may be procrastination&#x2019;s greatest gift: the chance to accomplish surprising, wonderful things by not sticking to a rigid schedule. For example, Perry wrote this book by avoiding the work he was supposed to be doing&#x2014;grading papers and evaluating dissertation ideas. How lucky for us.</p><p>John Perry is an emeritus professor of philosophy at Stanford University and currently teaches at UC Riverside.<br>He is the co-host of the nationally syndicated public radio program <i>Philosophy Talk</i>, and winner, in 2011, of an Ig Nobel Prize in Literature for the essay &#x201c;Structured Procrastination.&#x201d; He lives with his wife in Palo Alto, California.&#x201c;A splendid way to avoid one&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Ben Schott, author of <i>Schott&#x2019;s Original Miscellany</i><br><br> &#x201c;Do not put off reading this charming guide to more effective procrastination.

But it had been creeping into schools nationwide over the previous three years, and children were feeling its effects. They cried over math homework so mystifying their parents could not help them, even in elementary school. They read motley assortments of informational text&#x201d; instead of classic literature. They dreaded the high-stakes tests, in unfamiliar formats, that were increasingly controlling their classrooms.<br> <br>How did this latest and most sweeping reform&#x201d; of American education come in mostly under the radar? Joy Pullmann started tugging on a thread of reports from worried parents and frustrated teachers, and it led to a big tangle of history and politics, intrigue and arrogance. She unwound it to discover how a cabal of private foundation honchos and unelected public officials cooked up a set of rules for what American children must learn in core K 12 classes, and how the Obama administration pressured states to adopt them. Thus a federalized education scheme took root, despite legal prohibitions against federal involvement in curriculum.<br> <br>Common Core and its testing regime were touted as an absolute game-changer in public education,&#x201d; yet the evidence so far suggests that kids are actually learning less under it. Why, then, was such a costly and disruptive agenda imposed on the nation&#x2019;s schools? Who benefits? And how can citizens regain local self-governance in education, so their children&#x2019;s minds will be fed a more nourishing intellectual diet and be protected from the experiments of emboldened bureaucrats? <i>The Education Invasion</i> offers answers and remedies.<br></p><p>Joy Pullmann is managing editor of <i>The Federalist</i> and an education research fellow at the Heartland Institute. She received a Robert Novak journalism fellowship to fund research and reporting on Common Core. Pullmann has taught at grade levels from preschool to high school, tutored college students, and written public-speaking curriculum. A graduate of the Hillsdale College honors and journalism programs, she lives in the Midwest with her husband and four young children.<br>Jamie Highfill entered the classroom in 2002 as an eighth-grade English teacher in Fayetteville, Arkansas. A Gulf War veteran, she had no idea that she was stepping onto another battle field. <br> <br>Highfill quickly proved to be an excellent teacher. Her specialty was preparing students for Advanced Placement classes in high school, which can earn students college credit. In 2005, she was selected as codirector of the Northwest Arkansas Writing Project at the University of Arkansas, a local affiliate of an international writing program that attracts some of the world&#x2019;s best teachers. In 2011, the Arkansas Council of Teachers of English Language Arts named her Middle School English Teacher of the Year. In the 2011&#x2013;12 school year, 77 percent of her students scored &#x201c;advanced&#x201d; on state tests. That&#x2019;s an amazing success rate. Typically, no more than one-quarter of students score &#x201c;advanced&#x201d; on state English tests, even the less rigorous ones. <br> <br>Highfill&#x2019;s eighth graders learned about comedy and political satire from James Thurber&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&#x201d; and O. Henry&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Gift of the Magi.&#x201d; They read Arthurian legends, poems by Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson, and George Orwell&#x2019;s Animal Farm. They learned about internal dialogue, quest literature, parody, and symbolism. Highfill&#x2019;s guide for choosing assignments was Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s maxim, &#x201c;Read the best books first, or you might not have a chance to read them at all.&#x201d; <br> <br>When Arkansas signed on to the Common Core curriculum man- dates in 2010 &#x2015; to be followed later by national tests to enforce them &#x2015; Highfill joined the committee her school convened to decide how to put the mandates into place. Schools across the country created similar committees. <br> <br>In the era of &#x201c;education accountability,&#x201d; curriculum mandates spell out the learning requirements that annual tests assess. The national Common Core tests measure only reading and math to fulfill the federal mandates, but Common Core actually asserts authority over the entire curriculum, since its English mandates also apply to &#x201c;literacy in history/ social studies, science, and technical subjects. A series of grant competitions and executive rewrites of federal education law during the first year of the Obama presidency ensured that Common Core would determine far more than what teachers hand to children in the classroom. The administration required schools to use Common Core test results in evaluating, ranking, hiring, firing, and even redistributing teachers, and required states to use the results to judge and rank schools and even to take them over from local authorities. <br> <br>Unlike most teachers, Highfill had paid attention to how Common Core became her boss. When she got a look at the mandates, she was dismayed at what they would do to the extraordinarily rich lessons she had been providing her students. <br> <br>In language arts, Common Core explicitly requires schools to give &#x201c;much greater attention to a specific category of informational text &#x2015; literary nonfiction &#x2015; than has been traditional.&#x201d; A graph included in the standards document shows an increasing nonfiction intake through the school years: 50 percent in fourth grade, 55 percent in eighth grade, 70 percent in twelfth grade. This requirement alarmed Highfill, who had achieved great success with her students by feeding them a diet replete with poetry and short stories and classic novels. <br> <br>&#x201c;Where is the research that proves more nonfiction is better for students?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;What about inferencing skills that you only get with fiction and poetry? That was my whole issue: please, tell me where the research says this is better for kids.&#x201d; Indeed, research indicates that students&#x2019; experience with high-quality fiction is a major predictor of their college success, while it finds nothing of the kind for nonfiction. <br> <br>Highfill expressed her concerns to some colleagues. When administrators asked teachers what they thought about Common Core, Highfill and others began pointing out its flaws, but the principal said, &#x201c;You guys are being too negative.&#x201d; The administration, said Highfill, &#x201c;wanted us to accept the document lock, stock, and barrel.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Book of Drugs: A Memoir</h2><p>Mike Doughty first came to prominence as the leader of the band Soul Coughing then did an abrupt sonic left turn, much to the surprise of his audience, transforming into a solo performer of stark, dusky, but strangely hopeful tunes. He battled addiction, gave up fame when his old band was at the height of its popularity, drove thousands of miles, alone, across America, with just an acoustic guitar. His candid, hilarious, self-lacerating memoir, <b><i>The Book of Drugs</i></b>&#x2014;featuring cameos by Redman, Ani DiFranco, the late Jeff Buckley, and others&#x2014;is the story of his band's rise and bitter collapse, the haunted and darkly comical life of addiction, and the perhaps even weirder world of recovery.</p><p><b>Mike Doughty</b> is a musician and prolific blogger.

After establishing the distinctively Christian sense of brotherhood (vis-�-vis Judaism, Hellenism, Stoicism, the Enlightenment, and Marxism), he shows how fraternal charity can only be perfected through God&#39;s fatherhood, Christ&#39;s divine sonship, and our brotherhood in Christ.</p><p><p>"The timely republication of this work opens up vistas that have been obscured recently by controversy and confusion.

Although Grandmother had been dead for five years, no one had unpacked any of the boxes. They&#x2019;d been sitting in the attic collecting dust, their contents a mystery. Hoping to find something to read, I started pulling out books&#x2014;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Misty of Chincoteague, and at least a dozen Nancy Drew mysteries. At thirteen, I&#x2019;d long since outgrown Carolyn Keene&#x2019;s plots, but I opened one at random, The Bungalow Mystery, and began flipping the pages, laughing at the corny descriptions: &#x201c;Nancy, blue eyed, and with reddish glints in her blonde hair,&#x201d; &#x201c;Helen Corning, dark-haired and petite.&#x201d; The two girls were in a small motorboat on a lake, a storm was coming, and soon they were in big trouble. Just as I was actually getting interested in the plot, I turned a page and found a real-life mystery: a torn photograph.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In faded shades of yellow and green, Mom&#x2019;s older sister, Dulcie, grinned into the camera, her teeth big in her narrow face, her hair a tangled mop of tawny curls. Next to her, Mom looked off to the side, her long straight hair drawn back in a ponytail, eyes downcast, unsmiling, clearly unhappy. Dulcie was about eleven, I guessed, and Mom nine or ten. Behind the girls was water&#x2014;a lake, I assumed. Pressed against Dulcie&#x2019;s other side, I could make out an arm, a shoulder, and a few strands of long hair, just enough for me to know it was a girl. The rest of her had been torn away. I turned the photo over, hoping to find the girl&#x2019;s name written on the back.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Grandmother&#x2019;s neat, schoolteacherly handwriting: &#x201c;Gull Cottage, 1977. Dulcie, Claire, and T&#x2014;.&#x201d; Like her face, the rest of the girl&#x2019;s name was missing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone in the attic, I stared at the arm and shoulder. T . . . Tanya, Tonia, Traci, Terri. So many T names to choose from. Which was hers?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting the photo back in the book, I ran downstairs to ask Mom about Gull Cottage, the lake, and the girl. I found her in the kitchen chopping onions for the vegetable casserole she was fixing for dinner. Standing there, head down, she wore the same expression caught in the photograph. Not surprising. She always looked sad, even when she wasn&#x2019;t.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waved the photograph. &#x201c;Look what I found&#x2014;a picture of you and Dulcie at a lake somewhere. And another girl&#x2014;&#x201d; Mom snatched the photograph, her face suddenly flushed. &#x201c;Where did you get this?&#x201d; She acted as if I&#x2019;d been rummaging through her purse, her bureau drawers, the medicine cabinet, looking for secrets.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I backed away, startled by her reaction. &#x201c;It fell out of your old book.&#x201d; I held up The Bungalow Mystery.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It was in one of those boxes you brought back from Grandmother&#x2019;s house.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, here&#x2019;s your name.&#x201d; I pointed to &#x201c;Claire Thornton, 1977,&#x201d; written in a childish scrawl on the inside cover. Mom stared at the photograph as if I hadn&#x2019;t spoken. &#x201c;I was sure I&#x2019;d thrown this away.&#x201d; &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the girl sitting beside Dulcie?&#x201d; I asked, unable to restrain my curiosity.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Me,&#x201d; Mom said without raising her eyes. &#x201c;No, I mean on the other side, where it&#x2019;s ripped.&#x201d; I pointed. &#x201c;See her arm and her shoulder? On the back Grandmother wrote T, but the rest of her name was on the torn part.&#x201d; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember another girl.&#x201d; Mom gripped the photo and shook her head.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;At the lake, it was always Dulcie and me, just Dulcie and me. Nobody else.&#x201d; At that moment, Dad came through the kitchen door and set a grocery bag on the counter. &#x201c;Salad stuff,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t have field greens, so I got baby spinach.&#x201d; &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Mom said.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What are you looking at?&#x201d; Reaching over Mom&#x2019;s shoulder, he took the photo.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Little Claire and little Dulcie,&#x201d; he said with a smile. &#x201c;What a cute pair you were. Too bad the picture&#x2019;s torn&#x2014;and the color&#x2019;s so awful.&#x201d; Mom reached for the photo, but Dad wasn&#x2019;t finished with it. &#x201c;This must have been taken in Maine,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At your cottage.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She reached for the picture again.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey, look at this.&#x201d; Dad handed her the photo. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s another girl sitting next to Dulcie. See her arm? Who was she?&#x201d; &#x201c;This picture was taken thirty years ago,&#x201d; she said sharply. &#x201c;I have no idea who that girl was.&#x201d; Slipping the photo into her pocket, Mom went to the kitchen window and gazed at the backyard, which was just beginning to show green after the winter. With her back to us, she said, &#x201c;Soon it&#x2019;ll be time to mulch the garden.&#x201d; It was her way of ending the conversation, but Dad chose to ignore the hint. &#x201c;Your mom and aunt spent their vacations at Sycamore Lake when they were little,&#x201d; he told mee. &#x201c;They still own Gull Cottage, but neither one of them has gone there since they were kids.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;A cottage on a lake . . . I&#x2019;d love to see it.&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous,&#x201d; Mom said, her back still turned. &#x201c;The place has probably fallen to pieces by now.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why not drive up and take a look this summer?&#x201d; Dad asked her. &#x201c;Ali would love Maine&#x2014;great hiking, swimming, canoeing, and fishing. Lobster, clams, blueberries. We haven&#x2019;t had a real vacation for years.&#x201d; Mom spun around to face us, her body tense, her voice shrill. &#x201c;I hated going there when I was little. The lake was cold and deep and scary, and the shore was so stony, it hurt my feet. It rained for weeks straight. Thunder, lightning, wind, fog. The gnats and mosquitoes were vicious. Dulcie and I fought all the time. I never want to see Gull Cottage again. And neither does Dulcie.&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, come on, Claire,&#x201d; Dad said, laughing, &#x201c;it couldn&#x2019;t have been that bad.&#x201d; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know anything about it.&#x201d; Pressing her fingers to her temples, a sure sign of a headache, she left the room and ran upstairs. A second later, the bedroom door slammed shut.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to Dad, frustrated. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with Mom now?&#x201d; &#x201c;Go easy on her, Ali. You know how easily she gets upset.&#x201d; He sighed and headed toward the stairs. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have a math test tomorrow?&#x201d; Alone in the kitchen, I opened my textbook and stared at a page of algebra problems. Go easy on your mother, don&#x2019;t upset her, she can&#x2019;t handle it. How often had I heard that? My mother was fragile. She worried, she cried easily, sometimes she stayed in bed for days with migraine headaches. From the room overhead I could hear the drone of my parents&#x2019; voices. Mom&#x2019;s voice rose sharp and tearful. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told you before, I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it.&#x201d; Dad mumbled something. I closed my algebra book and retreated to the family room. With the TV on, I couldn&#x2019;t hear them arguing, but even a rerun of Law and Order couldn&#x2019;t keep me from thinking about the photo. I certainly hadn&#x2019;t meant to start a scene&#x2014;I just wanted to know who &#x201c;T&#x201d; was.</p> <p>I never saw the photo again. No one mentioned Sycamore Lake or Gull Cottage.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more we didn&#x2019;t talk about it, the more I thought about it. Who was &#x201c;T&#x201d;? Why didn&#x2019;t Mom remember her? If Grandmother had still been alive, I swear I would&#x2019;ve called her and asked who &#x201c;T&#x201d; was.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about calling Dulcie and asking her, but if Mom saw the number on the phone bill, she&#x2019;d want to know why I&#x2019;d called my aunt and what we&#x2019;d talked about. Mom had &#x201c;issues with Dulcie&#x201d;&#x2014;her words. They couldn&#x2019;t be together for more than a few hours without arguing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics, child raising, marriage&#x2014;they didn&#x2019;t agree on anything. Maybe because I couldn&#x2019;t talk to anyone about the photo, I began dreaming about &#x201c;T&#x201d; and the lake. Week after week, the same dream, over and over and over again. I&#x2019;m walking along the shore of Sycamore Lake in a thick fog. I see a girl coming toward me. I can&#x2019;t make out her face, but somehow I know it&#x2019;s &#x201c;T.&#x201d; She seems to know me, too. She says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better do something about this.&#x201d; She points at three girls in a canoe, paddling out onto the lake. One is my mother, one is Dulcie, and I think the third girl is &#x201c;T.&#x201d; But how can that be? Isn&#x2019;t she standing a few feet away? No, she&#x2019;s gone. The canoe vanishes into the fog. That&#x2019;s when I always woke up. Scared, shivering&#x2014;the way people feel when they say, &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s walking on my grave.&#x201d; I wanted to tell Mom about the dream, but I knew it would upset her. Although Dad didn&#x2019;t agree, it seemed to me she&#x2019;d been more nervous and anxious since I&#x2019;d shown her the photograph. She started seeing her therapist again, not once but twice a week. Her headaches came more frequently, and she spent days lying on the couch reading poetry, mainly Emily Dickinson&#x2014;not a good choice in my opinion for a depressed person.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dickinson&#x2019;s poems were full of things I didn&#x2019;t quite understand but frightened me. Her mind was haunted, I thought, by death and sorrow and uncertainty.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I suspected that&#x2019;s why Mom liked Dickinson&#x2014;they were kindred spirits.</p> <p>Except for my dream and Mom&#x2019;s days on the couch, life went on pretty much as usual. Dad taught his math classes at the university, graded exams, gave lectures, and complained about lazy students and boring faculty meetings&#x2014;standard stuff. I got involved in painting scenery for the school play and doing things with my friends. As the weather warmed, Mom cheered up a bit and went to work in her flower garden, mulching, transplanting, choosing new plants at the nursery&#x2014;the best therapy, she claimed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Dulcie paid us an unexpected visit and threw everything off track.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright � 2007 by Mary Downing Hahn.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reprinted by permission of Clarion Books / Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.</p></p><h2>The Philosopher&#39;s Stone: Alchemy and the Secret Research for Exotic Matter</h2><p><p>Prolific author Joseph P.

Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves is the answer to this universal wish. It is not about gentle ways to control a child, but about a way of being and of understanding a child so she/he can be the best of herself, not because she fears you or seeks your approval but because she wants to, of her own free will. Aldort's guidance takes the struggle out of parenting. The book is full of real life stories, often leaving the reader moved to tears or laughter and relieved to discover that there is a kinder way. The SALVE communication formula has been praised for providing a hybrid of The Work of Byron Katie and Nonviolent Communication. It gives parents the tools to move beyond their initial unproductive reaction, to a response that is connecting and empowering to the child and to themselves. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Naomi Aldort</b> is the author of <i>Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves</i>, sold in thirteen languages.

From there, he goes back more than two thousand years to the city&#x2019;s foundation, one mired in mythologies and superstitions that would inform Rome&#x2019;s development for centuries. He explores in rich detail the formation of empire, the rise of early Christianity, the Crusades, the Renaissance, and takes us up to the present, through the rise and fall of Mussolini&#x2019;s fascism. Equal parts idolizing, blasphemous, outraged, and awestruck, <i>Rome</i> is a portrait of the Eternal City as only Robert Hughes could paint it.</p><p><b>Robert Hughes </b>was born in Australia in 1938. Beginning in 1970 he lived and worked in the United States, where until 2001 he was chief art critic for <i>Time</i>. His books include <i>The Shock of the New, The Fatal Shore, Nothing If Not Critical, Barcelona, Goya, </i>and <i>Things I Didn't Know</i>. He was the recipient of numerous awards and prizes for his work. Hughes died in 2012.1<br><br>Foundation<br><br>Although nobody can say when Rome began, at least there is reasonable certainty of where it did. It was in Italy, on the bank of the river Tiber, about twenty-two kilometers inland from its mouth, a delta which was to become the seaport of Ostia.<br><br>The reason no one can pinpoint when the foundation took place is that it never ascertainably did. There was no primal moment when a loose scatter of Iron and Bronze Age villages perched on hills agreed to coalesce and call itself a city. The older a city is, the more doubt about its origins, and Rome is certainly old. This did not prevent the Romans from the second century b.c.e. onward coming up with implausibly exact-looking dates for its origins: Rome, it used to be asserted, began not just in the eighth century but precisely in 753 b.c.e., and its founder was Romulus, twin brother of Remus. Here a tangled story begins, with many variants, which tend to circle back to the same themes we will see again and again throughout Rome's long history: ambition, parricide, fratricide, betrayal, and obsessive ambition. Especially the last. No more ambitious city than Rome had ever existed, or conceivably ever will, although New York offers it competition. No city has ever been more steeped in ferocity from its beginnings than Rome. These wind back to the story of the city's mythic infancy.<br><br>In essence, the story says that Romulus and Remus were orphans and foundlings, but they could claim a long and august ancestry. It stretched back to Troy. After Troy fell (the legendary date of this catastrophic event being 1184 b.c.e.), its hero Aeneas, son of Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite or Venus, had escaped the burning city with his son Ascanius. After years of wandering on the Mediterranean, Aeneas fetched up in Italy, where Ascanius (now grown up) founded the city of Alba Longa, not far from the eventual site of Rome, traditionally in about 1152 b.c.e.<br><br>Here, Ascanius' progeny began a line of kings, his descendants. The last of the line was called Amulius, who wrested the throne of Alba Longa from its rightful occupant, his elder brother, Numitor.<br><br>Numitor had one child, a daughter named Rhea Silvia. Amulius the usurper used his convenient, newly seized power to make her a vestal virgin, so that she could not produce a son, who might be not only Amulius's heir but also a deadly threat to him. But the war god, Mars, no respecter of either virginity or vestality, impregnated Rhea Silvia. Amulius, realizing she was pregnant, had Rhea Silvia imprisoned; presently she died of ill treatment-but not before delivering her twin sons, Romulus and Remus.<br><br>We have the great historian Livy's word for what happened next. Amulius ordered his men to fling little Remus and Romulus into the Tiber. But the river had been in flood, and its waters had not yet receded. So, rather than wade right out into the current and get uncomfortably wet, they merely dumped the babies into the shallower floodwater at the river's edge, and went away. The level of the Tiber dropped some more, stranding the twins in the mud. In this state, wet but still alive, they were found by a she-wolf, which benignly nourished them with its milk until they were old and strong enough to be brought to adulthood by the royal herdsman Faustulus. (Most visitors, when they see the bronze sculpture in the Museo dei Conservatori of the Founding Babies sucking on the pendulous conical teats of the <i>lupa</i>, naturally think it is one original piece. It is not; the wolf is ancient and was cast by an Etruscan craftsman in the fifth century b.c.e., but Romulus and Remus were added c. 1484-96 by the Florentine artist Antonio del Pollaiuolo.)<br><br>In any case, in the myth they eventually overthrew Amulius and restored their grandfather Numitor to his rightful place as king of Alba Longa. And then they decided to found a new settlement on the bank of the Tiber, where chance had washed them ashore. This became the city of Rome.<br><br>Who would be its king? This was settled by an omen in the form of a flight of birds of prey. Six of them appeared to Remus but twelve to Romulus, thus marking him-by a majority vote from the gods above, as it were-as the indisputable ruler of the new city.<br><br>Where exactly was it? There has always been some disagreement over the original, "primitive" site of Rome. There is no archaeological evidence for it. It must have been on one of the Tiber's banks-which one, nobody knows. But the district is famous for having had seven hills-the Palatine, the Capitoline, the Caelian, the Aventine, the Esquiline, the Viminal, and the Quirinal. Nobody can guess which one it may have been, although it is likely that the chosen site, for strategic reasons, would have been a hill rather than flatland or a declivity. Nobody was keeping any records, so no one can guess which one of these swellings, lumps, or pimples was a likely candidate. "Tradition" locates the primitive settlement on the modest but defensible height of the Palatine Hill. The "accepted" date of the foundation, 753 b.c.e., is of course wholly mythical. There was never any possibility of authenticating these early dates-of course nobody was keeping any records, and since later attempts at recording the annals of the city, all belonging to the second century b.c.e. (the writings of Quintus Fabius Pictor, Polybius, Marcus Porcius Cato), only began to be made approximately five hundred years after the events they claim to describe, they can hardly be deemed trustworthy. But they are all we have.<br><br>Supposedly, Romulus "founded" the city that bears his name. If things had gone differently and Remus had done so, we might now talk about visiting Reem, but it was Romulus who, in legend, marked out the strip of land that defined the city limits by hitching two oxen, a bull and a cow, to a plow and making a furrow. This was called the <i>pomerium</i> and would be the sacred track of the city wall. This, according to Varro, was the "Etruscan rite" for the founding of a city in Latium. Ritual demanded that the furrow, or <i>fossa</i>, the small trench of symbolic fortifications, should lie outside the ridge of earth raised by the plowshare; this ridge was called the <i>agger</i> or earthwork. The walls of the city were raised behind this symbolic line, and the space between it and the walls was scrupulously kept free of building and planting, as a defensive measure. The area within the <i>pomerium</i> would come to be called <i>Roma quadrata</i>, "square Rome," for obscure reasons. Evidently Remus took exception to it, for reasons equally unknown. Perhaps he objected to Romulus' assuming the right to determine the shape of the city. He showed his disagreement by jumping over the furrow-an innocent act, one might think, but not to Romulus, who took it for a blasphemous expression of hostile contempt and murdered his twin brother for committing it. History does not tell how Romulus may have felt about slaying his only brother over a perceived threat to his sovereignty, but it is perhaps significant that the sacred group that ran around the <i>pomerium</i> at intervals to assure the fertility of Roman flocks and women in later years was known as the Luperci or Wolf Brotherhood.<br><br>So the embryo city, rooted in an unexplained fratricide, had one founder, not two, and as yet no inhabitants. Romulus supposedly solved this problem by creating an asylum or a place of refuge on what became the Capitol, and inviting in the trash of primitive Latium: runaway slaves, exiles, murderers, criminals of all sorts. Legend makes it out to have been (to employ a more recent simile) a kind of Dodge City. This can hardly be gospel-true, but it does contain a kernel of symbolic truth. Rome and its culture were not "pure." They were never produced by a single ethnically homogeneous people. Over the years and then the centuries, much of Rome's population came from outside Italy- this even included some of the later emperors, such as Hadrian, who was Spanish, and writers like Columella, Seneca, and Martial, also Spanish-born. Celts, Arabs, Jews, and Greeks, among others, were included under the wide umbrella of Romanitas. This was the inevitable result of an imperial system that constantly expanded and frequently accepted the peoples of conquered countries as Roman citizens. Not until the end of the first century b.c.e., with the reign of Augustus, do we begin to see signs of a distinctively "Roman" art, an identifiably "Roman" cultural ideal.<br><br>But how Roman is Roman? Is a statue dug up not far from the Capitol, carved by a Greek artist who was a prisoner-of-war in Rome, depicting Hercules in the style of Phidias and done for a wealthy Roman patron who thought Greek art the ultimate in chic, a "Roman" sculpture? Or is it Greek art in exile? Or what? <i>Mestizaje es grandeza</i>, "mixture is greatness," is a Spanish saying, but it could well have been Roman. It was never possible for the Romans, who expanded to exercise their sway over all Italy, to pretend to the lunacies of racial purity that came to infect the way Germans thought about themselves.<br><br>Several tribes and groups already inhabited the coastal plain and hills around the Tiber. The most developed in the Iron Age were the Villanovans, whose name comes from the village near Bologna where a cemetery of their tombs was discovered in 1853. Their culture would mutate by trade and expansion into that of the Etruscans by about 700 b.c.e. Any new settlement had to contend, or at least reach an accommodation, with the Etruscans, who dominated the Tyrrhenian coast and most of central Italy-a region known as Etruria. Where they originally came from remains a mystery. In all likelihood, they had always been there, despite the belief held by some in the past that the Etruscans' remote ancestors had migrated to Italy from Lydia, in Asia Minor. The most powerful Etruscan city close to Rome was Veii, a mere twelve miles to its north-though the cultural influence of the Etruscans spread so wide that they made themselves felt far in the south, in what later became Pompeii. Until they were eclipsed by the rising power of Rome, around 300 b.c.e., they laid down the terms of culture in central Italy.<br><br>Never a centralized empire, they created city-states along the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy: Veii, Caere (now Cerveteri), Tarquinia, Vulci, and others, all of them ruled by high-priestly kings called Lucumones. Some of these settlements were linked in a loose federation, with ritual similarities and defense and trade agreements. Because of their military superiority-the Etruscan "tank" was a bronze- fitted chariot, and the basic unit of Etruscan warfare was a heavy- armored, close-knit phalanx, the ancestor of the Roman legion-they could dominate the less tightly knit forces of their tribal rivals, until the Romans moved in.<br><br>Other minor tribal groupings held territory in the neighborhood of Rome as well, one of these being the Sabines. They seem to have been hill people and shepherds, and their settlement may have been on the Quirinal Hill. An expansionist from the beginning, Romulus seems to have decided to go after this territory first. In order to lure the Sabines and their women within reach, Romulus is said to have held some horse races during the Festival of Consus (in August). The whole Sabine population turned up, and at a signal the Romans abducted all the young women they could lay their hands on. This amounted to a declaration of war between the Romans and the infuriated Sabines. (All Romans were Latins, but not all Latins were Romans. Roman power, including the power to confer Roman citizenship, was vested in Rome, and citizenship became an esteemed honor.) The Sabine King Titus Tatius gathered an army and marched against the Romans. But, in another scene made legendary by later artists such as Jacques-Louis David, the kidnapped Sabine women flung themselves between the two sides of furious males-brothers, fathers, husbands-and persuaded them to make peace, not war.<br><br>Peace and alliance between Sabine and Latin now prevailed. Romulus supposedly ruled the united tribes for another thirty-three years, and then dramatically vanished from the earth, wrapped in the thick darkness of a thunderstorm. Six kings are traditionally said to have succeeded Romulus, some Latin, others (notably the semi-legendary sixth-century rulers Tarquinius Priscus and Tarquinius Superbus, "Tarquin the Arrogant") supposedly Etruscan. In legend, their succession began with Numa Pompilius, who reigned for forty-three years and established in Rome "an endless number of religious rites and temples." He was followed by Tullus Hostilius, who conquered the Albans and the people of the Etruscan settlement of Veii; by Ancus Marcius, who added the Janiculan and Aventine hills to Rome; by Tarquinius Priscus, said to have established the Roman Games; by Servius Tullius, who added the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline hills and finished off the Sabines; and by Tarquin the Arrogant, who murdered Servius. Servius' son, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, made peace between Latins and Etruscans. These kings established the <i>mons Capitolinus</i>, the Capitoline Hill, as the citadel and sacred center of Rome. Here the temples to the goddesses Minerva and Juno were raised, and, most sacred and important of all, the temple to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, "Jupiter Best and Greatest." It was (supposedly) dedicated by King Tarquin in 509 b.c.e. Although little is known about Tarquin the Arrogant as a historical figure, he contributed to most languages an expression which lives and is used down to the present day. According to Livy (who was writing about half a millennium later), the king taught a lesson with it to his son, Sextus Tarquinius, the future rapist of Lucretia. Having just conquered an enemy city, Tarquin was strolling with his boy in their garden when he began to chop off the heads of the tallest poppies in it. This, he explained, was the thing to do with leading citizens of a fallen town, who might cause trouble in defeat. Hence the modern term, especially loved and all too often used by sneering Australians to level the society around them, "tall- poppy syndrome."<br><br>The authority of kings in Rome lasted about two hundred years. Succession was not hereditary. During this time, the kings were in essence elected-not by all classes of the Roman people, but by the city's richest and most powerful elders, who (with their families) came to be known as the<i> patricii</i>, the patricians. These constituted a governing class, choosing and then advising the rulers of Rome. After the disappearance of the last king, Tarquinius Superbus, whom the patricians expelled and refused ever to replace, a system evolved that was designed never to put such authority in one man's hands again. Supreme authority was granted not to one but to two chosen figures, the consules (consuls). Their powers were exactly equal, and one could overrule the other: thus the Roman state could take no action on any issue unless both consuls agreed on it. This at least saved the Roman state from some of the follies of autocracy. From now on, the prospect of "kingship" would be a political bogey to Romans; the consul Julius Caesar, to take the outstanding example, would be assassinated by a cabal of republicans who feared that he might make himself a king. Meanwhile, the religious powers of the kings were hived off and invested in a supreme priest, known as the pontifex maximus.</p><h2>Farm</h2><p>Society of Illustrators 2006 Gold Medal recipient, Elisha Cooper, captures the smell, taste, and feel of the changing seasons on a farm.<br><br>Society of Illustrators 2006 Gold Medal recipient, Elisha Cooper, captures the smell, taste, and feel of the changing seasons on a farm.<br>There is so much to look at and learn about on a farm - animals, tractors, crops, and barns.

The heavily illustrated narrative, which begins in March and ends in November, describes how each season brings different sights, smells, and activities. Using a variety of machinery, the farmers prepare for planting, harvesting, and storing crops of feed corn. The children are involved in growing and maintaining a smaller garden of vegetables and feeding the cows and chickens. As the weather becomes warmer, there is time to relax on a tire swing or fish in a creek, but the family will have to make trips into town for supplies and business transactions. While they have plenty to eat, young readers will glimpse some of the hardships of their life. Weather can delay a farmer's plans and nearby wildlife means danger for some of the barnyard animals. The watercolor and pencil artwork, highlighting the open skies and vast prairie fields, complements the text and changes from browns to greens as the temperature rises and falls. Although the text is too long for a read-aloud, and the small images are best appreciated one-on-one, Cooper's book will give children a comprehensive view of farm life, both visually and textually.&#x2014;<i>Tanya Boudreau, Cold Lake Public Library, AB, Canada</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I sometimes have the impression that I'm as thoroughly feminist as I am thoroughly human, that feminism is as intrinsic to my constitution as my skeleton is to my body. But in my thirty-five years, I've struggled with or outright rejected feminism on several occasions: first, as an ignorant adolescent ("What do women need feminism for if we've already got the vote?"); then, as a sex worker who saw how regularly and even gleefully feminists stoked the public's long-standing antipathy toward professionally sexual women; and now, again, as someone moving ever further into the far left, who cannot abide the forms of feminism that embrace and are complicit with the worst aspects of liberalism.<br><br>The more I learn about the intersecting, oppressive forces that continue to shape the Western world-colonialism, patriarchy, capitalism, xenophobia, and racism-and the network of cruel social machinery to which these systems give rise-incarceration, crippling debt, disenfranchisement, deportation, and so on-the less sense it makes to use gender as the primary lens through which to regard human-engineered suffering. Feminism doesn't feel like the sharpest weapon to wield against white supremacy or border policing, for instance, or even the best tool with which to approach basic civic concerns like vibrant schools. That's not because those issues don't impact women; obviously, they directly and indirectly impact many. But they don't necessarily impact women more or in dramatically different ways than they do men. In other words, the most significant challenges those issues present aren't tethered to one's sex. And so prioritizing gender above other aspects of identity limits one's realm of ethical response.<br><br>Here's an example. American prisons often keep female prisoners shackled while they give birth. There are variations on the theme: Some women are shackled during labor, some are unshackled during but then shackled again almost immediately afterward, and almost all are shackled while heavily pregnant. There's some variation of what shackling entails, too. It can mean being cuffed at the wrists, or at the ankles, or both-or cuffed to a hospital bed, or chained at the waist. Articulating these details makes the sadism even starker.<br><br>A class action federal lawsuit in 2017 alleged more than forty women at the Milwaukee County Jail suffered this horror. It was preceded by lawsuits in 2014 and 2016 against the same jail for similar practices. But the appalling practice is hardly confined to one city or even one state. In 2015, New York prisons were found to be shackling prisoners in labor in spite of a state law that made it illegal to do so. And according to a 2016 report by the Prison Birth Project and Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, jails and prisons in Massachusetts were guilty of similar violations.<br><br>Most feminists probably agree that this is a feminist issue; the topic accordingly receives coverage on feminist websites and sometimes in women's magazines. But does a feminist obligation to attend to the rights of the imprisoned extend only as far as pregnancy and labor? Is it a feminist issue when a nonpregnant woman is shackled? Or when she is caged for years and exploited for her labor, denied face-to-face visits from loved ones, held captive in a compound in the name of "justice"? If the answer to these questions is yes, then is it also a feminist issue when men are shackled during various health emergencies-seizures, say? (In 2014, a male inmate in Colorado died after undergoing several seizures while in restraints and receiving no medical treatment.) Is it a feminist issue when incarcerated men are denied the right to visit with family, or exploited for their labor? Is it a feminist issue that so many men are raped while in prison? Or does feminism's responsibility begin and end with gender-based mistreatment?<br><br>The feminists hired by prominent media outlets often advocate for measures that would result in higher levels of incarceration. They write op-eds in favor of further criminalization around sex work, and call for longer prison sentences for men convicted of assault-which we've known for decades is not necessarily synonymous with "men who've committed the crime." They also, disturbingly, relish the theater of sentencing like that enacted by Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who told serial sexual abuser Larry Nassar that if she could, she would "allow some or many people to do to him what he did to others." (So, sexual violation is an atrocity . . . unless it happens to the right person?) They capitalize on women's justified fear and anger around mistreatment by men to shore up the status quo, to suggest that our current problems are not the result of fundamentally unjust institutions, but rather institutions that are only incidentally sexist. That means those same institutions could become less so with the right adjustments, like more draconian sentencing for crimes against women, or more female judges.<br><br>But the prison system is racist and brutal by design, not by accident or mismanagement, just as the court system regularly fails the most vulnerable because it was built to protect the powerful. "The challenge of the twenty-first century is not to demand equal opportunity to participate in the machinery of oppression," revolutionary thinker Angela Davis has written. "Rather, it is to identify and dismantle those structures." Yet leveraging our existing legal system for criminalization remains the go-to strategy for most feminists when it comes to dealing with objectionable behavior. Criminalization entails fines and incarceration; it does not meaningfully concern itself with rehabilitation, education, victim care, or prevention. Its ability to deter other potential offenders is unproven-or, arguably, proven to be nonexistent, as is especially demonstrable with laws against drug use and possession-and the recidivism rate is astronomical. Moreover, the legal system is not accessible to everyone. Undocumented people cannot use it. People leading already criminalized lives, like sex workers, often cannot use it, and marginalized people are also discouraged from or outright prevented from using it by a slew of means. (The most obvious of which is usually time and money.)<br><br>This instinct to turn to the state is not unfamiliar to me. I, too, learned from a young age that laws and courts and police are the way to deal with almost everything: You notice something is wrong, you get a law passed or use an existing law to stop it, and the problem is solved. This is not how our current laws work in practice, and it is incumbent upon us to face that fact with honesty and creativity. When activists speak out against police and prisons, people immediately demand that they offer a replacement apparatus, but it is an impossible demand. The transformation needs to be more profound than a simple swap. Prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba speaks on this point with great eloquence: "We have to transform the relationships we have with each other so we can really create new forms of safety and justice in our communities. [The work of abolition] insists that it is necessary that you change everything." [emphasis added.]<br><br>Many feminists, though, have lost their foremother's radical vision of changing everything. Instead, they are ready to work within the tight confines of an ineffective system, and they endorse and invest in a de facto police state. The "feminist" modifier itself is useless for indicating a stance on this issue, as it is for many others: protecting the rights of trans women, for instance, or even the legality of abortion.<br><br>This tension is long-standing and perhaps inevitable given that feminism is assumed to galvanize people under a banner of gender rather than shared ideological and moral commitments, as a formal organization, like a political party or a local activist group, would. There's no explicit platform for feminism because it's an idea, ownerless and atomized, based on the observation of one specific, persistent source of imbalance in a stunningly unfair world. It can be invoked (cynically or sincerely) by anyone, which is part of why it's been so easily co-opted by corporations who use superficial gestures of pro-women sentiment for brand management, and by a mainstream media that anoints clueless celebrities like Lena Dunham, Taylor Swift, and Amy Schumer as the vanguard of righteous, pro-lady politics.<br><br>Aside from for-profit institutions muddying the waters, there's also the matter of individual dissent. Even groups with clear and detailed mission statements run into internal disagreement. That's healthy and good. But today's concept of feminism provides such a wide net that some women (and men) assume gender alone makes one eligible for membership, regardless of actual convictions. "Feminist" has become synonymous with hollow phrases like "female empowerment" and "strong women" and "girl power." If a woman's ambition were automatically feminist by virtue of her gender alone, that would hold true whether she's directing her energies into exploiting workers in other countries, trying to overturn affirmative action, or working to keep her neighborhood free from immigrants.<br><br>Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In campaign notoriously exemplifies this sort of self-serving attitude. In her 2010 TED Talk and 2013 book by the same name, Sandberg exhorted working women to throw themselves into the corporate world, implying that women's general lack of representation in the boardroom was a function of their own timidity and emotionality rather than workplace discrimination or intractable secondary obstacles (like being unable to afford childcare, or simply not wanting to sacrifice quality of life for a title). Why is it important that women assume more prominent roles in corporations? Because their absence indicates sexism, and sexism is bad. Or because they'd bring "diversity," and diversity makes a company stronger. A number of similar platitudes could be offered in response to this question, but none would be sufficient. By assuming that having more women is better, period, we relinquish the opportunity to question what it is the corporation does (read: who it harms and how it harms them), what's inherently good about climbing to the top of any hierarchy, or how it socially benefits all women for one particular woman to earn an obscene amount of money.<br><br>The feminism espoused by Sandberg goes by many names-neoliberal feminism, white feminism, corporate feminism-but whatever it's called, its priority is to help a small number of people further consolidate power and money without rocking the proverbial boat. Few systems are threatened by slotting women into roles traditionally held by men, because absolute wealth and absolute power tend to corrupt absolutely. Few want to dismantle the means by which they achieve tremendous success; rather, they want to further consolidate that success in all its forms: influence, wealth, and so on. If patriarchy's worst offense were keeping women out of the workplace, then sure, women like Sheryl Sandberg would be triumphs of the cause. But the notion that women shouldn't work outside the home was always unique to the white upper and middle classes. Poorer women never had the option to stay at home, and Black women in the United States have virtually always been expected to work, if not in the fields then in white homes as "domestic" servants. The far more noxious effects of patriarchy, like rendering women incapable of exercising autonomy over their reproduction or paying them lower wages for their work, can and do endure even with more women "on top." You never have to look very far to find female politicians voting to make abortion less accessible, or female activists trying to take down Planned Parenthood, just as you don't have to search very hard to find powerful women who explicitly blame other women for their own sexual assault or who, ? la Ann Coulter, go so far as to suggest women shouldn't have the right to vote.<br><br>So not only is Lean In feminism useless for achieving a truly pro-women future wherein all women see their lives improved, but it actively undermines that vision. It's a feminism that purports to push for progress while wedding itself to the perpetuation and justification of patriarchy's equally insidious attendants: capitalism, imperialism, racism, ableism, and so on. Every other hierarchy may remain intact as long as (some) women are allowed a shot at approaching the top. By participating in unjust power structures, and giving those same structures a fresh patina of legitimacy, this feminism places a radically reimagined future further out of reach for the people-women and men alike-who so desperately need it.<br><br>Ignoring the problems of less advantaged women to secure the rights, and later, the high-profile achievement, of the privileged has been part of feminism's legacy since the beginning. Suffragettes (who were primarily white and middle or upper class) were often outspoken racists who fomented anti-Black sentiment, participating in segregation and endorsing colonialism. Various white figureheads of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s were willfully ignorant about and explicitly unconcerned by the social concerns shared by women of color; they also disavowed lesbians and tried to keep them apart from the larger movement. Today, many prominent British feminists stoke anti-trans fears among their followers and rally for further criminalization and stigmatization of sex work-in spite of the fact that doing so demonstrably keeps female (and male, and non-gender-conforming) sex workers extraordinarily vulnerable. American feminists are quieter on these issues, but then, they're quiet on a lot of issues-namely, almost anything that doesn't revolve around (white, cis) women's reproductive options and (white, cis) women's experience of sexual assault or harassment, or cultural representation as measured by women directing big-budget films and winning awards.<br><br>Mainstream feminism fails us because, by definition, it adheres to the status quo and nudges it only slightly to the left, if at all. It wouldn't be mainstream if it didn't play by these rules. But the status quo is actively harmful to almost everyone, regardless of gender. It concentrates wealth in the hands of the .01 percent (us' 3 richest men have more wealth than half of the population was a repeated headline in late 2017 following the release of a report by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.) It keeps many of us underemployed and terrified of getting sick, lest we need medical care that far outstrips our resources. It allows police officers to murder with impunity. It renders voting inaccessible to huge swaths of the adult population. It ravages communities with gun violence. It breaks our hearts, and it makes it harder to start every day with enough hope to work for something better.<br><br>Perhaps the most apt name for this kind of feminism, then, is sabotage feminism. It exists to stymie the efforts of the most radical feminist values-those that put the most disadvantaged among us first, not last-by turning the very idea of feminism on itself, by feeding feminism its own tail. Second-wave feminists-those active in the late 1960s through the '80s-envisioned a profound remaking of society on sexual, familial, and economic levels. These years birthed the dreams of wages for housework, the Equal Rights Amendment, and unapologetic abortion on demand, and it offered women a fantasy of solidarity as they rallied behind those efforts. But whatever wave of feminism we're experiencing now might be best described as no wave, for it leaves us bereft of unity, momentum, and power as we compete against ...</p><h2>Learn Watercolour Quickly: Techniques And Painting Secrets For The Absolute Beginner (Learn Quickly)</h2><p>Start painting&#x2014;in just one afternoon!

Born in Poland in 1913, Begin was a youthful admirer of the Revisionist Zionist Ze&#x2019;ev Jabotinsky and soon became a leader within Jabotinsky&#x2019;s Betar movement. A powerful orator and mesmerizing public figure, Begin was imprisoned by the Soviets in 1940, joined the Free Polish Army in 1942, and arrived in Palestine as a Polish soldier shortly thereafter. Joining the underground paramilitary Irgun in 1943, he achieved instant notoriety for the organization&#x2019;s bombings of British military installations and other violent acts.<br><br>Intentionally left out of the new Israeli government, Begin&#x2019;s right-leaning Herut political party became a fixture of the opposition to the Labor-dominated governments of Ben-Gurion and his successors, until the surprising parliamentary victory of his political coalition in 1977 made him prime minister. Welcoming Egyptian president Anwar Sadat to Israel and cosigning a peace treaty with him on the White House lawn in 1979, Begin accomplished what his predecessors could not. His outreach to Ethiopian Jews and Vietnamese &#x201c;boat people&#x201d; was universally admired, and his decision to bomb Iraq&#x2019;s nuclear reactor in 1981 is now regarded as an act of courageous foresight. But the disastrous invasion of Lebanon to end the PLO&#x2019;s shelling of Israel&#x2019;s northern cities, combined with his declining health and the death of his wife, led Begin to resign in 1983. He spent the next nine years in virtual seclusion, until his death in 1992. Begin was buried not alongside Israel&#x2019;s prime ministers, but alongside the Irgun comrades who died in the struggle to create the Jewish national home to which he had devoted his life. Daniel Gordis&#x2019;s perceptive biography gives us new insight into a remarkable political figure whose influence continues to be felt both within Israel and throughout the world.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>This title is part of the Jewish Encounters series.</i></p></p><p><p><b>Daniel Gordis </b>is the award-winning author of <i>Saving Israel. </i>His previous books include<i> If a Place Can Make You Cry, The Promise of Israel, Home to Stay, </i>and <i>God Was Not in the Fire.</i> He is a regular contributor to <i>The Jerusalem Post, </i>and has written for <i>The New York Times, The New Republic,</i> and <i>The New York Times Magazine,</i> among other publications. He is Senior Vice President and Koret Distinguished Fellow at Shalem College in Jerusalem.</p><p><b><i>Introduction</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>One of my most vivid college memories is of Menachem Begin. It was November 1977, the first semester of my freshman year. The radio was on, and I heard the news that President Anwar Sadat of Egypt had accepted Prime Minister Begin&#x2019;s invitation to come to Jerusalem. <br>&nbsp;<br>I can still picture the moment. The doorway in front of me, my roommate&#x2019;s desk to the left. The cinder-block walls we&#x2019;d painted soon after we&#x2019;d moved in. I leaned my head against the door frame, closed my eyes, and prayed that Begin would stay alive long enough to see the process through.<br>&nbsp;<br>I knew virtually nothing about Begin then. I&#x2019;d lived in Israel for a couple of years as a young child but had been all too happy to depart, and subsequently ignored Israeli politics almost entirely. I still cared enough about Israel, though, that the newscast stopped me in my tracks. The prospect of peace in Israel was so stunning that, for the first time in my life, I found myself begging some power out there to take care of Menachem Begin.<br>&nbsp;<br>It may have been the first time that I truly prayed.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>Four years later, on my honeymoon in Hawaii, I was walking back from the beach with my new wife when we stopped to peer into a local newspaper vending machine. &#x201c;Israel Bombs Iraqi Nuclear Reactor,&#x201d; the headline said, and we both laughed out loud. People in Hawaii, it seemed, would believe anything. <br>&nbsp;<br>Back at the hotel, we absentmindedly turned on a brand-new cable network called CNN. Israel, it reported, had destroyed Iraq&#x2019;s Osirak nuclear reactor. The attack had been ordered by Menachem Begin. We asked ourselves and each other questions people had been asking about Begin for decades: Had he just made the world safer, or had he recklessly endangered it? Was the attack reprehensibly irresponsible, as the United States would soon claim, or was it the courageous step of someone who knew better than anyone else how to safeguard the future of the Jewish people?<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>I never met Begin, never even saw him in person. But he is an indelible part of my freshman year, my honeymoon, and many other subsequent moments I will never forget. When my wife and I eventually moved our family to Israel many years later, countless taxi drivers, listening to the news of whatever calamity was unfolding at the moment, would turn around to tell me, &#x201c;You know what this country needs? We need Menachem Begin.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was not only the taxi drivers. Even Israel&#x2019;s left-leaning newspaper, <i>Haaretz, </i>which had regularly railed against his policies, sometimes wondered wistfully when the next Begin would appear. In 2012, twenty years after Begin died, <i>Haaretz </i>published a long retrospective on his life entitled &#x201c;Menachem Begin&#x2014;the Man Who Transformed Israel.&#x201d; And several months later, when Israel was caught up in yet another international crisis, a <i>Haaretz </i>column noted that &#x201c;in 1977, it was Menachem Begin who began to extricate Israel from its isolation. It is unclear if there is anyone willing and able to do so in 2013.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Everyone, it seems, misses Menachem Begin.<br>&nbsp;<br>I wrote this book to find out why. I wanted to understand how someone so polarizing, so controversial, in his own country and abroad, can appear today as the soul not only of Israel&#x2019;s best self but as a living fusion of Jewish consciousness and national aspiration.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>All of Israel&#x2019;s founders made extraordinary journeys, but it is hard to imagine any of them enduring an odyssey anything like Begin&#x2019;s. He fled the Nazis, lost his parents and brother, was imprisoned by the Soviets and hunted by the British. Condemned by Albert Einstein and Hannah Arendt in the pages of <i>The New York Times, </i>scorned by Israel&#x2019;s political elites, portrayed by many as a demagogue, and relegated to the political opposition for twenty-eight years, he served as prime minister for six years, and in that time made peace with Egypt, received the Nobel Peace Prize, and destroyed Iraq&#x2019;s nuclear reactor. He also led Israel into its most unpopular war, resigned as a result of the war&#x2019;s dark course before his term was completed, and went into seclusion for almost a decade. An orator who thrived on crowds, he was almost never seen or heard from again.<br>&nbsp;<br>When he died, though, tens of thousands of people choked the streets of Jerusalem, desperate to make their way to the Mount of Olives, where he was buried. They hadn&#x2019;t forgotten him. They wanted to say good-bye. And they wanted to thank him.<br>&nbsp;<br>To thank him for what? What was it that Menachem Begin evoked in Israelis and in Jews worldwide? Loved by many, reviled by others, his life and the principles to which he was committed touched something profound in Jews almost everywhere. The key to Begin&#x2019;s abiding grip on the memory and fascination of Israelis and Jews around the world was bound up with his unabashed, utter devotion to the Jewish people. Committed to Israel though he was, Menachem Begin&#x2019;s life was a story of commitment first and foremost to the Jewish people. Many of Israel&#x2019;s founders Hebraized their names (Ben-Gurion actually required diplomatic personnel and civil servants above a certain rank to do so2). David Ben-Gurion was born David Gr�n. Ariel Sharon&#x2019;s original last name was Scheinermann. Golda Meir had been Golda Meyerson. But Menachem Begin did not change his name. His Jewish roots were the only roots that he needed or wanted; when called upon to testify before a commission of the Knesset toward the end of his life, and asked to state his name, he answered, simply, &#x201c;Menachem ben Dov ve-Chasia Begin.&#x201d; It was not an Israeli name, but a Jewish one. It was a reminder that Israel mattered only if the Jews mattered. He never became the toned and bronzed Israeli in the new tradition of Dayan, Sharon, or Yitzhak Rabin, nor a self-invented member of the old guard like Ben-Gurion. He had no need for that. His devotion to Israel was an irrepressible facet of the European Jew he had always been, and unlike many of Israel&#x2019;s founders, he saw no reason to leave that tradition or legacy behind.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the age of the &#x201c;new Jew,&#x201d; Begin carried with him a fierce pride in what he had inherited. The love that Israelis and Jews around the world felt for him, regardless of what they may have thought of his policies, derived in large measure from his having reminded them who they were and would always be.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book is the story of Menachem Begin&#x2019;s life, but it is also the story of what he evoked in Jews, of what he said to the world about Jewish history and the Jewish people, and of the legacy he bequeathed to the state he was instrumental in creating.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>Given how fascinating, perplexing, controversial, and beloved he was, it should come as no surprise that Menachem Begin&#x2019;s life has been thoroughly researched. He is the subject of several biographies, including the recent comprehensive treatment by Avi Shilon, <i>Menachem Begin: A Life </i>(recently translated from the Hebrew). Other biographies have been written by a longtime friend and advisor (Harry Hurwitz), by foreign journalists (Eric Silver and Ned Temko), by an Israeli journalist (Eitan Haber), by those who served with Begin in the Jewish underground or worked with him in government (Aryeh Naor, among others). Other writers composed biographies even when he was still in office (Aviezer Golan and Shlomo Nakdimon), and another wrote a volume with a psychological bent (Ofer Grosbard), seeking to get to the core of what animated him. Memoirs, such as Hart Hasten&#x2019;s <i>I Shall Not Die, </i>include lengthy personal recollections of Begin. Yehuda Avner (Begin&#x2019;s colleague, friend, and English speechwriter, who subsequently served as Israel&#x2019;s ambassador to Australia and the United Kingdom) is the author of <i>The Prime Ministers, </i>which has done more than any other book to bring Menachem Begin to the attention of an English-reading generation that knew little of him. All of these books have contributed immensely to this volume.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition to these and other biographies, Begin was covered widely in the press, both in Israel and abroad. There are voluminous archives at the Menachem Begin Heritage Center, the Jabotinsky Institute in Israel, and Israel&#x2019;s National Archives. And, because Begin lived not long ago, there are still scores of people alive who had extensive interaction with him. Many of those people were kind enough to be interviewed and to contribute further insight to this study.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book makes no attempt to offer itself as a definitive biography of Menachem Begin. It takes no stand on what Begin would have thought Israel ought to do today. Nor does it pretend to cover every dimension of Begin&#x2019;s fascinating, multifaceted public and private life. Many of the events in which Begin was involved are still shrouded in mystery or mired in controversy. I have adopted the positions that seem to me supported by the strongest evidence, but I am fully aware that on some key issues, deeply knowledgeable people disagree on key facts and interpretations.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a book of this length, there are, of necessity, many dimensions of Begin&#x2019;s life that are either addressed far too briefly or left altogether untouched. Drawing on research already done and coupling it with new archival work and numerous new interviews, my goal was&#x2014;a century after Begin&#x2019;s birth&#x2014;to bring his extraordinary life to the attention of an even wider audience and to look at his life through the lens of the passion he still evokes. What was the &#x201c;magic&#x201d; of his draw? What was it about him that touched so deep a nerve in Jewish people, as well as in non-Jews, in Israel and throughout the world? I hope that this book will help address those questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps most important, I hope that this book will lead us all to examine once again what it was about Menachem Begin&#x2019;s view of the world that led him to defend his people with such devotion, and what it is about rediscovering his legacy that might prompt us to do the same.</p></p><h2>Paul Meets Muhammad: A Christian-Muslim Debate on the Resurrection</h2><p>Imagine if the Apostle Paul were alive to defend the truth of Jesus's resurrection-only to be countered by none other than the prophet Muhammad himself.<br><br>In an approach as creative as any scholar has taken, Michael R.

I just wanted to answer a few questions you might have. This is not a book that asks you to take supplements or eat an organic diet in order to get pregnant and stay pregnant. It's unlike any other book on conception out there because it's written in a way that allows you to naturally boost and also extend and prolong your fertility without the use of drugs or medical intervention. Trying to Get Pregnant and Succeeding is a new, different and very effective way to get pregnant quickly and safely and to have a healthy, happy, full term pregnancy.<br><br> I have worked with women with fertility issues all over the world&nbsp;for over 25 years and they taught me so much about the role the mind plays in fertility. This book is the culmination of everything I learnt that really does work. I was told I would never be able to have children so I do understand how painful, distressing and stressful infertility is. However I used my research and understanding of how the mind works to overcome my infertility and I only began helping other women to have babies once I had successfully had my own.<br><br> So many infertility books have a "one size fits all" mentality, assuming that all women with infertility have the same problem- they don't. All the infertility books I looked at cover diet, lifestyle and vitamins but ignore the role that the mind plays in blocking conception, when this is the most important factor to consider and work on in order to have a baby. &nbsp;There are different types of infertility including unexplained infertility, secondary infertility, medical infertility and age or trauma related infertility and each type needs a particular method to bring about a cure. <br><br> It was important for me to write a book that would help any woman anywhere in the world who was experiencing problems getting and staying pregnant. &nbsp;This book shows you how to easily get pregnant even by your next cycle and it's easy, simple and painless. There are no gimmicks- just solutions. Reading it will change the way you think.

Sometimes it is forgotten that he was also a pastor and shepherd of souls. Collected in this volume are Luther&#39;s letters of spiritual counsel, which he offered to his contemporaries in the midst of sickness, death, persecution, imprisonment, famine, and political instability. For Luther, spiritual counsel was about establishing, nurturing, and strengthening faith. Freshly translated from the original German and Latin, the letters shed light on the fascinating relationship between his pastoral counsel and his theology. Theodore G.

Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.</p><h2>Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture (Annotated)</h2><p>Author J.

Our place in the universe is extraordinary, they claim, because the universe will never be in this moment of time again, and we have a responsibility to take care of the Earth since there is still time to solve some of our cosmic problems.

Using theological and social history research, Bakke compares Greco-Roman and Christian attitudes toward abortion and child prostitution, pedagogy and moral upbringing, and the involvement of children in liturgy and church life. He also assesses Christian attitudes toward children in the church&#39;s developing doctrinal commitments. Today, growing numbers of children are impoverished, exploited, abandoned, orphaned, or killed. Bakke&#39;s insightful work begins to untangle the roots of their complex plight.</p><p>O. M.

While most guests are fixed on the happy couple, Jared&#x2019;s cousin Graydon can&#x2019;t look away from a bridesmaid, Toby Wyndam. It&#x2019;s not just her quiet beauty that enthralls him or the way she makes him laugh. Toby possesses the truly remarkable ability of being able to distinguish Graydon from his identical twin brother, Rory. According to family legend, such a gift marks her as Graydon&#x2019;s True Love.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Graydon knows there is no possible way that they can ever be together, for he is heir to the Lanconian throne and is to marry a noble woman who has been chosen for him. Yet, intrigued by Toby, he asks her to help him hide on Nantucket for a week away from regal responsibilities. In exchange, he&#x2019;ll assist her with planning acclaimed novelist Victoria Madsen&#x2019;s lavish wedding. Since they both know their union is impossible, the pair promises that they will never be more than just friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there&#x2019;s more going on between Graydon and Toby than her unique power to tell him apart from his twin.

The bride and his cousin Jared, the groom, were standing at the front of the little chapel, the pastor between them, and Graydon kept looking across them at her. She had on a blue bridesmaid dress, was holding a bouquet of flowers, and her attention was fully on the ceremony.<br><br>While she was pretty, she wasn&#x2019;t conventionally so. She wasn&#x2019;t the type of woman who&#x2019;d make people do double takes. With her oval face, eyes the color of bluebells, and flawless skin, she looked like a girl you&#x2019;d see in the newspaper as having attended a debutante ball. She&#x2019;d be able to wear pearls and long gloves without looking like she&#x2019;d rather be in jeans.<br><br>Earlier, when the four wedding attendants had been waiting outside, there&#x2019;d been a lot of commotion inside the little chapel. At the last minute, some kind of mix-�up had caused a great deal of chaos. In normal circumstances, Graydon would have made an effort to find out what was happening, but not today. Today he was distracted by her.<br><br>Sounds of angry shouts and furniture crashing to the floor had come from inside the chapel. The two bridesmaids and the other groomsman went to the door to see what was going on, but Graydon stood where he was. He wasn&#x2019;t even curious. All he could do was gaze at the back of the young woman. She had long blonde hair that curled down her back, and a nice figure. Not flashy, but trim and subdued.<br><br>Through all the turmoil, Graydon had stood back from them. He was only vaguely aware of the surroundings, of the big tent that was set up for dinner and dancing, of the moonlight on the wooded area around them, even of the brightly lit chapel where the wedding was to be. He seemed only able to think about what the young woman had said to him just minutes before.<br><br>When Graydon had been asked to escort a bridesmaid down the aisle, he&#x2019;d thought it would be an easy, enjoyable task. After all, he was certainly used to red carpets and ceremonies of all kinds.<br><br>But when he was introduced to the young woman, he&#x2019;d been shocked by what she said&#x2014;�and he still hadn&#x2019;t recovered.<br><br>When the noise inside the chapel finally calmed down and they prepared to go inside, Graydon moved to stand beside her and crooked his arm for her to take. When she put her hand on his arm, he smiled warmly at her, slipped his hand over hers, and clasped it gently.<br><br>Without a word, she snatched her hand away, took two steps back, and glared at him. There was no mistaking her meaning: He was to make no overtures of any kind toward her. And that seemed to include even friendliness.<br><br>Graydon didn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d ever before been at a loss for words, but in the face of her anger, every language he knew seemed to disappear from his mind. All he could do was stand there and blink. Finally, he managed to nod his agreement. No touching, no smiles, no anything outside what was necessary to get the job done.<br><br>As they walked down the aisle together, she kept her distance from him. Her hand was on his arm, but her body was two feet away from his. Graydon held his head high, doing his best to swallow his pride. Never before had a woman found him . . . well, repulsive. Truthfully, no woman had ever before tried to get away from him.<br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t naive&#x2014;�he knew well that a lot of the fawning and flirting directed his way was because of what he&#x2019;d come to think of as the &#x201c;unfortunate circumstances of my birth,&#x201d; but still . . . That she didn&#x2019;t want anything to do with him wounded his ego.<br><br>When they got to the front of the chapel, she seemed relieved to get away from him. She went to the left, and Graydon went to the other side to wait for the bride to come down the aisle with her father.<br><br>Throughout the ceremony Graydon couldn&#x2019;t help peering around the bride and groom to look at her. What was her name? Toby, wasn&#x2019;t it? Surely that was a nickname, and he wondered what her birth name was.<br><br>As the ceremony neared the end, Graydon felt that old familiar pull, what people called the &#x201c;twin bond,&#x201d; and he knew his brother was there. He glanced to his left, through the crowd of people packed into the chapel. Family was in chairs but the back was full of guests standing and watching. It took Graydon only seconds to find his brother in the very back, purposely hidden behind other people. Rory wasn&#x2019;t dressed properly for a wedding, but then his leather jacket and casual slacks fit in with the American style. At least his brother didn&#x2019;t have on jeans.<br><br>Rory nodded toward the blonde bridesmaid in question. He&#x2019;d never seen his brother stare at a woman before and he was curious as to why.<br><br>As was sometimes the case with identical twins, he and his brother often communicated without words. But there was no way Graydon could tell his brother the one and only thought in his mind: She can tell you and me apart.<br><br>Frowning, Rory let Graydon know that he didn&#x2019;t understand. He slanted his head to one side and Graydon nodded. They had just arranged to meet outside as soon as possible.<br><br>That done, Graydon gave his attention back to the young woman. In a moment they&#x2019;d again walk down the aisle, and he looked forward to it.</p><h2>The Carrion Throne (1) (Vaults of Terra)</h2><p>Inquisitor Erasmus Crowl and his acolyte Spinoza follow the trail of a shadowy conspiracy on Holy Terra itself, the capital world of the Imperium.<br><br>In the hellish sprawl of Imperial Terra, Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Erasmus Crowl serves as a stalwart and vigilant protector, for even the Throneworld is not immune to the predations of its enemies.

As he plunges deeper into the shadowy underbelly of the many palace districts, his investigation attracts the attention of hidden forces, and soon he and his acolyte Spinoza are being hunted &#x2013; by heretics, xenos, servants of the Dark Powers, or perhaps even rival elements of the Inquisition itself.

In Molly Brodak&#x2019;s dazzling memoir, <i>Bandit</i>, her eye is so honest, I found myself nodding like I was agreeing with her, sometimes cringing at what she sustained, and laughing often. I can&#x2019;t wait to buy a copy for everyone I know.&#x201d; Kathryn Stockett, author of <i>The Help</i></b><br><br>In the summer of 1994, when Molly Brodak was thirteen years old, her father robbed eleven banks, until the police finally caught up with him while he was sitting at a bar drinking beer, a bag of stolen money plainly visible in the backseat of his parked car. Dubbed the Mario Brothers Bandit&#x201d; by the FBI, he served seven years in prison and was released, only to rob another bank several years later and end up back behind bars.<br><br>In her powerful, provocative debut memoir, <i>Bandit</i>, Molly Brodak recounts her childhood and attempts to make sense of her complicated relationship with her father, a man she only half knew. At some angles he was a normal father: there was a job at the GM factory, a house with a yard, birthday treats for Molly and her sister. But there were darker glimmers, too another wife he never mentioned to her mother, late-night rages directed at the TV, the red Corvette that suddenly appeared in the driveway, a gift for her sister. Growing up with this larger-than-life, mercurial man, Brodak&#x2019;s strategy was to get small&#x201d; and stay out of the way. In <i>Bandit</i>, she unearths and reckons with her childhood memories and the fracturing impact her father had on their family and in the process attempts to make peace with the parts of herself that she inherited from this bewildering, beguiling man.<br><br>Written in precise, spellbinding prose, <i>Bandit</i> is a stunning, gut-punching story of family and memory, of the tragic fallibility of the stories we tell ourselves, and of the contours of a father&#x2019;s responsibility for his children.<br></p><p><b>Molly Brodak</b> is from Michigan and currently lives in Georgia.

It provides an eye into the more personal side of the criminal mind, asking the biggest questions about what makes us who we are, whether we really know the things we think we know. We&#x2019;ve all read the true crime accounts of man&#x2019;s personal depravity, but never has there been one telling this side of the story, at least not one armed with such patience, poetry, humanity.

For a fearless girl called Justice Jones, super-smart super-sleuth, it&#39;s just the start of a spine-tingling first term at Highbury House Boarding School for the Daughters of Gentlefolk. For fans of Robin Stevens, Katherine Woodfine and Enid Blyton. When Justice&#39;s mother dies, her father packs her off to Highbury House Boarding School for the Daughters of Gentlefolk. He&#39;s a barrister - specialising in murder trials - and he&#39;s just too busy to look after her alone. Having previously been home-schooled, the transition is a shock. Can it really be the case that blondes rule the corridors? Are all uniforms such a charming shade of brown? And do schools normally hide dangerous secrets about the murder of a chamber maid? Justice takes it upon herself to uncover the truth. (Mainly about the murder, but perhaps she can figure out her new nemesis - the angelic Rose - at the same time.) But when a storm cuts the school off from the real world, the body count starts to rise and Justice realises she&#39;ll need help from her new friends if she&#39;s going to find the killer before it&#39;s too late ...</p><p></p><h2>Auto Math Handbook HP1554: Easy Calculations for Engine Builders, Auto Engineers, Racers, Students, and Per formance Enthusiasts</h2><p>A completely revised edition of the bestselling guide which includes updated photographs, math equations, and formulas, as well as new chapters on computer technology, racing, aerodynamics, suspension, and chassis dynamics.</p><p><b>John Lawlor</b> was an automotive editor and writer for <i>Motor Trend, Car Life,</i> and <i>Road &amp; Track</i>, among others. <br><b>Bill Hancock</b> is the co-author of <i>Dyno Testing and Tuning</i>.</p><h2>The New Man: Becoming a Man After God&#39;s Heart</h2><p>Dan Doriani understands the challenges of being a man, and he knows you don&#x2019;t need more man-made lists to excel as a husband, father, or leader.

The quest for a breakthrough battery or a 100 mpg car are dangerous fantasies. We are consumers, and we like to consume green and efficiently. But David Owen argues that our best intentions are still at cross purposes to our true goal - living sustainably and caring for our environment and the future of the planet. Efficiency, once considered the holy grail of our environmental problems, turns out to be part of the problem. Efforts to improve efficiency and increase sustainable development only exacerbate the problems they are meant to solve, more than negating the environmental gains. We have little trouble turning increases in efficiency into increases in consumption.</p><p>David Owen's <i>The Conundrum</i> is an elegant nonfiction narrative filled with fascinating information and anecdotes takes you through the history of energy and the quest for efficiency. This is a book about the environment that will change how you look at the world. We should not be waiting for some geniuses to invent our way out of the energy and economic crisis we're in. We already have the technology and knowledge we need to live sustainably. But will we do it?</p><p>That is the conundrum.</p></p><p><b>David Owen</b>&nbsp;is a staff writer for&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker&nbsp;</i>and the author more than a dozen books.

Yet, he was largely held to blame for the Confederacy's defeat at Gettysburg. <i>General James Longstreet</i> sheds new light on the controversial commander and the man Robert E. Lee called &#x201c;my old war horse.&#x201d;</p><p>This isn't the first biography to be written on Confederate General James Longstreet, but it's the best--and certainly the one that pays the most attention to Longstreet's performance as a military leader. Historian Jeffry D. Wert aims to rehabilitate Longstreet's reputation, which traditionally has suffered in comparison to those of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Some Southern partisans have blamed Longstreet unfairly for the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg; Wert corrects the record here. He is not uncritical of Longstreet's record, but he rightly suggests that if Lee had followed Longstreet's advice, the battle's outcome might have been different.<p> The facts of history cannot be changed, however, and Wert musters them on these pages to advance a bold claim: "Longstreet, not Jackson, was the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia; in fact, he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side." Wert describes his subject as strategically aggressive, but tactically reserved. The bulk of the book appropriately focuses on the Civil War, but Wert also briefly delves into Longstreet's life before and after it. Most interestingly, it was framed by a friendship with Ulysses S. Grant, formed at West Point and continuing into old age. Longstreet even served in the Grant administration--an act that called into question his loyalty to the Lost Cause, and explains in part why Wert's biography is a welcome antidote to much of what has been written about this controversial figure. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>Jeffry D. Wert is the author of&nbsp;eight previous books on Civil War topics, most recently <i>Cavalryman of the Lost Cause </i>and&nbsp;<i>The Sword of Lincoln</i>.

You know, one of those places where they turn rich old guys into Popsicles? Gram had been hearing odd noises from her cellar for a while now, and she was convinced it was this dying freezer she kept there. So my punishment for the day was to clean it out and stuff everything into these jack-o&#x2019;-lantern leaf bags that Gram had been saving since who knows how many Halloweens ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grandma land, even the contents of the freezer were way different than what I was used to. Agreeing on what a freezer should hold seemed to be the only thing my new stepfather and I had in common. But here, instead of meeting up with my best buds Ben&nbsp;and Jerry, I was finding nemo and his friends, wrapped up in white packages with writing on the outside so you could clue into whichever member of the magical forest had taken a hit and when.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stuffed &#x201c;Duck&#x201d; and then &#x201c;Venison&#x201d; and &#x201c;Walleye&#x201d; into another one of the pumpkin bags. Man, those packages had been waiting to be set free longer than I had. Maybe the noises Gram had been hearing weren&#x2019;t from the freezer. Maybe they were from the ghosts of all these dead things, plotting up some serious revenge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I reached the bottom of the frozen graveyard, Gram&#x2019;s cellar was feeling a lot like one of those the-killer-is-in-the-basement places, where the stupid kid always ends up kicking it in slasher movies. only one big ice-covered box was left. I bent over the side of the freezer chest and tugged at the corner of the box. Not enough leverage&#x2014;the thing was iced in place as if it had been gorilla-glued.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hoisted my upper half deep into the chest and yanked again. No go. I&nbsp; leaned way over, hanging on to the edge of the freezer with one hand while I grabbed the box with the other. Then I got my Hulk on and gave one last mighty pull.<br>That&#x2019;s when nemo and his friends finally took their revenge. Turned out the stupid box was heavier than I&#x2019;d realized. I&nbsp; leaned too far and pulled too hard, and then the box broke free and I over-ended into the appliance of death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was falling in, something rolled out of the box into the bottom of the freezer. the last thought I had before I landed on it was that maybe I had some mutant form of jet lag or something. Because I could have sworn it looked exactly like a head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp; frozen human head.</p></p><h2>Teaching for Learning: 101 Intentionally Designed Educational Activities to Put Students on the Path to Success</h2><p><p>Despite a growing body of research on teaching methods, instructors lack a comprehensive resource that highlights and synthesizes proven approaches. <i>Teaching for Learning</i> fills that gap.

At the beginning of Western philosophy, Aristotle contrasted beings formed by nature, which had within themselves a beginning of movement and rest, and man-made objects, which did not have the source of their own production within themselves. This book, the first of three volumes, revises the Aristotelian argument and develops an innovative assessment whereby the technical object can be seen as having an essential, distinct temporality and dynamics of its own. The Aristotelian concept persisted, in one form or another, until Marx, who conceived of the possibility of an evolution of technics. Lodged between mechanics and biology, a technical entity became a complex of heterogeneous forces. In a parallel development, while industrialization was in the process of overthrowing the contemporary order of knowledge as well as contemporary social organization, technology was acquiring a new place in philosophical questioning. Philosophy was for the first time faced with a world in which technical expansion was so widespread that science was becoming more and more subject to the field of instrumentality, with its ends determined by the imperatives of economic struggle or war, and with its epistemic status changing accordingly. The power that emerged from this new relation was unleashed in the course of the two world wars. Working his way through the history of the Aristotelian assessment of technics, the author engages the ideas of a wide range of thinkers&#x2015;Rousseau, Husserl, and Heidegger, the paleo-ontologist Leroi-Gourhan, the anthropologists Vernant and Detienne, the sociologists Weber and Habermas, and the systems analysts Maturana and Varela.</p><p>Bernard Stiegler is Assistant Director of the Institut National de l&#39;Audiovisuel, Paris.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Sextus Empiricus: Outlines of Scepticism (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)</h2><p>Outlines of Scepticism, by the Greek philosopher Sextus Empiricus, is a work of major importance for the history of Greek philosophy.

The book concentrates on the ongoing client therapist relationship and ways in which the therapist's responses can stimulate and enable a client's capacity for direct experiencing and "focusing." Throughout, the client therapist relationship is emphasized, both as a constant factor and in terms of how the quality of the relationship is manifested at specific times. The author also shows how certain relational responses can turn some difficulties into moments of relational therapy. <br></p><p>Eugene T.

Every integrated software development environment in the world-open-source, standards-based, and proprietary-now supports Uml and, more importantly, the model-driven approach to software development. This makes learning the newest Uml standard, Uml 2.0, critical for all software developers-and there isn&#39;t a better choice than this clear, step-by-step guide to learning the language. -Richard Mark Soley, Chairman and Ceo, Omg If you&#39;re like most software developers, you&#39;re building systems that are increasingly complex. Whether you&#39;re creating a desktop application or an enterprise system, complexity is the big hairy monster you must manage. The Unified Modeling Language (Uml) helps you manage this complexity. Whether you&#39;re looking to use Uml as a blueprint language, a sketch tool, or as a programming language, this book will give you the need-to-know information on how to apply Uml to your project. While there are plenty of books available that describe Uml, Learning Uml 2.0 will show you how to use it. Topics covered include: Capturing your system&#39;s requirements in your model to help you ensure that your designs meet your users&#39; needs Modeling the parts of your system and their relationships Modeling how the parts of your system work together to meet your system&#39;s requirements Modeling how your system moves into the real world, capturing how your system will be deployed Engaging and accessible, this book shows you how to use Uml to craft and communicate your project&#39;s design. Russ Miles and Kim Hamilton have written a pragmatic introduction to Uml based on hard-earned practice, not theory. Regardless of the software process or methodology you use, this book is the one source you need to get up and running with Uml 2.0.

A member of the bourgeois Jewish community in Cairo, Kahanoff grew up in a time of coexistence. She spent the years of World War II in New York City, where she launched her writing career with publications in prominent American journals. Kahanoff later settled in Israel, where she became a noted cultural and literary critic.</p> <p><i>Mongrels or Marvels</i> offers Kahanoff's most influential and engaging writings, selected from essays and works of fiction that anticipate contemporary concerns about cultural integration in immigrant societies. Confronted with the breakdown of cosmopolitan Egyptian society, and the stereotypes she encountered as a Jew from the Arab world, she developed a social model, Levantinism, that embraces the idea of a pluralist, multicultural society and counters the prevailing attitudes and identity politics in the Middle East with the possibility of mutual respect and acceptance.</p></p><p>Deborah A.

All cops are. But he knew he was more than that: he liked to get involved in the lives around him. He had a need to know which went beyond voyeurism. It was a drug. And the thing was, when he had all this knowledge, he then had to use booze to blank it out..." In his ninth outing, Edinburgh's glowering and tenacious Inspector John Rebus finds a unique way of cutting back on alcohol. Convinced that Rebus might lie or try to destroy evidence in the reopened case of a man convicted of a murder he probably didn't commit, the investigating officer assigns him a babysitter. Luckily, the minder is one of Rebus's old mentors, Jack Morton, a former drinking buddy now waging a successful battle against the bottle. Rebus and Morton burn off energy and anger repainting Rebus's apartment, while trying to clear Rebus's name and exploring the connection between a recent string of murders and a real-life Scottish serial killer of the 1970s known as Bible John. The cases take Rebus to Aberdeen and an oil platform in the North Atlantic, but as usual the main action happens within the mind and soul of Rankin's meticulously crafted creation.

After the show, Sam was left behind to make peace with the Hells Angels, the various mobsters and organizations who had taken an overt interest in the event, and the people of America. There has never been an official investigation into events at Altamont and those involved have never before spoken on record. Sam Cutler has decided that it is time to put to rest the myths and legends that have grown up around this infamous event in rock history and for the first time reveal the truth. Sam survived Altamont and went on to live the ultimate rock and roll dream. This is also his own account of the high ol&#x2019; times he had managing tours for San Francisco band the Grateful Dead who went on to become the world's most successful live act. Along the way Sam draws intimate portraits of other stars of the psychedelic circus that was the music industry in the sixties and seventies, including Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Band, the Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, and Eric Clapton.

She lives in Paris.I&#x2019;m not at all sure if you know that I&#x2019;m alive . . .<br><br>1<br><br>I never will forget the day I went to see a movie which you know all about if you&#x2019;ve been watching television lately: Anthony Adverse. I won&#x2019;t mention the year I saw it, but it had just come out, and I was in it, and I was just nineteen. I went in the afternoon, to the very first matinee at Grauman&#x2019;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Because I&#x2019;d been in films only a year and this was the fifth and best I&#x2019;d so far made, I was very thrilled and excited, sitting in the dark waiting for the picture to begin. I was also enjoying the rest, because, as you&#x2019;ve surmised, I was just a little overworked.<br><br>The grand moment came, and with treble voice, her hair hanging down her back, Angela, the character I played, made her first appearance. As she did so, I heard a lady behind me exclaim to another beside her, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Olivia de Havilland!&#x201d;<br><br>There followed a silence disturbed only by the muted flapping of my ears. Then the second woman queried, &#x201c;I wonder how old she is?&#x201d;<br><br>There was no silence this time as the first lady replied with promptness and with certitude, &#x201c;Why, she&#x2019;s thirty if she&#x2019;s a day!&#x201d;<br><br>This incident has marked me, and because of it I&#x2019;m not at all sure if you know that I&#x2019;m alive. I have the idea that anyone who has ever heard my name has the distinct impression that I was put under the sod years ago just before they buried Lillian Russell. And so, when I wonder if you know that I live in France, I&#x2019;m sure you don&#x2019;t, because I am certain that you think me peacefully interred, and in good old native American soil.<br><br>If that&#x2019;s the case, you&#x2019;re in for a surprise. By golly, I&#x2019;m alive, all right, and I do live in France, and not under but on top of solid Parisian limestone. Furthermore, I speak First Class Foreign French, and if I&#x2019;ve stunned you into immobility by all this startling information, you just keep seated and keep quiet, and I&#x2019;ll tell you how it all came about.<br><br>About nine years ago I was living (yes, even then) a life both sober and sobered, although conducted in Hollywood. I had very regretfully come to realize that a divorce from my first husband was necessary, and in August of 1952 had filed for and been granted an interlocutory decree of divorce. In the early spring of 1953 a film I&#x2019;d been in, My Cousin Rachel, had just come out, and I was staying very much at home reading scripts for another one and keeping my eye on the apple of my eye, my three-year-old son, Benjamin Briggs Goodrich. If that sounds like a feat, it was, as he is the most active apple I have ever encountered.<br><br>While I was thus engaged, Louella was unhappy, Hedda was unhappy, and the publicity department at Fox, where I&#x2019;d made Rachel, was unhappy. They wanted me to fall in love. And you don&#x2019;t do that if you stay at home with your nose in a script and your eye on its apple, because, among other things, you are just too contorted to do so. Louella, Hedda, my agent, and Fox just didn&#x2019;t understand; they wagged their heads and remarked sadly, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one male she loves, and that&#x2019;s Ben.&#x201d;<br><br>About six thousand miles away, on the other side of the Atlantic, the French government was busying itself with its usual occupations and, in addition, preparing for the Cannes Film Festival. As the chestnut trees along the Champs �lys�es were getting ready to bloom, the office of the Secr�taire G�n�ral put a lot of white envelopes in the mail; one of them was addressed to me.<br><br>When it arrived at my Hollywood apartment, I deflected my gaze from Benjamin for a moment and read the enclosed invitation. I&#x2019;d never been to France and I&#x2019;d never been to a Festival, and after a fifth of a second of solemn deliberation I decided to accept. Forthwith I sent a message to the French government, which had graciously agreed to provide my transportation to and from the Festival, that I&#x2019;d be happy to come if it would send me two airplane tickets instead of one.<br><br>Do you know, that simple, frank little request absolutely rocked the French government? And it&#x2019;s a government that&#x2019;s had its ups and downs. The Secr�taire G�n�ral of the Festival went right over to see the Secr�taire G�n�ral of Paris Match, France&#x2019;s most celebrated illustrated magazine, because the Secr�taire G�n�ral of Paris Match had actually been to Hollywood and had actually met some American actresses on home ground and could, no doubt, give some advice about my request. He could and he did. Seeing straight through my petition and seeing no reason why the French government should subsidize American romance, he said with clear, cogent brevity, &#x201c;Non.&#x201d;<br><br>So while Louella and Hedda were shocked because I was not in love, two French Secr�taire G�n�rals were shocked because I was. When I wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>When the Secr�taire G�n�ral of the Festival finally learned that my proposed companion, though male, was exactly three and a half years old, his French family spirit came to an immediate and joyful boil, and without further ado and by fastest courier he dispatched to me two airplane tickets instead of one.<br><br>A month later, as the plane bringing Ben and me to France circled over Orly Field in the midmorning mid-April sunshine, I speculated as to what the very first Frenchman I would meet would be like. Unquestionably, he&#x2019;d be dapper, with an Adolphe Menjou mustache. Naturally, he&#x2019;d be gay, effervescent; he&#x2019;d gesticulate. He&#x2019;d be voluble in French, expressive in English. Of course he would kiss my hand. And that would be charming.<br><br>The plane landed and Ben and I emerged into the tonic, sun-filled air. We descended the ramp while the 580,000 photographers who hospitably greet each arriving Festival guest flashed every one of their 2,000,000 flash bulbs. Then we approached the air terminal door where my American, German-born, French-speaking agent was waiting for us. He was in Europe on business, and because I didn&#x2019;t know a word of French, he had come to see me through my first hours on foreign soil. With him was a Frenchman. The very first Frenchman I met in France. Handsome but hangdog. Cleanshaven and solemn. Didn&#x2019;t speak English, didn&#x2019;t even speak French. And did not kiss my hand. He was the Secr�taire G�n�ral of Paris Match.<br><br>We met again forty-eight hours later at Cannes, in the revolving door of the Carlton Hotel. I was on my way to the opening night of the Festival and so was he. I wore a pink evening gown, long gloves and mink; he wore dinner clothes and his hangdog expression. More intense, though. Sort of hangdog and sheepish. He did not speak English, he did not speak French, and he did not kiss my hand.<br><br>My seat at the Palais du Festival throughout the festivities was always reserved, always the same&#x2014;in the dress circle, one in from the aisle. Who was on the aisle? Every night, every performance, in his own reserved seat? The Secr�taire G�n�ral of Paris Match.<br><br>At the great supper parties after every film, at no matter whose table I sat, oddly enough, always beside me in his unreserved seat was the same singular Frenchman. Then at the Austrian Gala his expression changed. He smiled. Then he spoke. Fluently. In French, which I did not understand. Then in English, which I did. But he still did not kiss my hand&#x2014;he held it in the taxi going home.<br><br>This opening skirmish swiftly developed into a major campaign, international in scale, range, and implication. As soon as the Festival was over I withdrew with my three-year-old aide-de-camp to England. We were overtaken. We retreated behind and beyond the national boundaries of the United States, even unto the heart of Texas.<br><br>Retrenched in Dallas, I went into rehearsal for The Dazzling Hour, a play which, by the way, was not to be presented in Dallas at all but in La Jolla, California. That&#x2019;s hard to follow, I know, but it involves Jos� Ferrer, the very mention of whose name will make clear any confusion. You know Joe&#x2014;if there&#x2019;s anything he hates to do it&#x2019;s one thing at a time; in Dallas he was acting, singing, dancing and joking in Kiss Me, Kate, rehearsing The Dazzling Hour, and getting married. And in Dallas, even though the eyes of Texas were upon him, the one-man French Expeditionary Force made an airborne landing.<br><br>I fled, aide-de-camp and all, to La Jolla. Again we were routed. In Los Angeles my aide nearly reversed the field when, by the merest hazard, in the high spirits of healthy American youth, he struck the opposition an accidental blow on the top of the head with a potato masher. However, as August 26 came around my divorce became final, the adversary pursued his advantage undaunted, and by the end of the month, as one of the most intense and relentlessly fought operations in French military history came to a close, the tricolor rose triumphantly in the California sunshine over the Shoreham Apartments and I announced my engagement to Pierre Galante.<br><br>A few weeks later the victor set sail for his native shore in the barque the Libert�, and at the same time, by merest coincidence, Air France sent me an invitation to christen and be aboard their inaugural Chicago&#x2013;Paris nonstop flight. Needless to say, enclosed with the invitation were two airplane tickets instead of one.<br><br>I planted my own standard on the Left Bank of the River Seine in late October of 1953, and though I have since transferred it to the Right Bank, it has been fluttering with considerable joy and gaiety from that first moment to this one. My aide-de-camp is now twelve years old, and because settling down in a foreign country requires quite a bit of staff work, Pierre and I have given him an assistant. She is now five years old, is named Gis�le, and has all the requisites for a happy life that any girl could ask for: a full set of teeth, pretty legs, and a mouth like a kiss. She thinks her brother is God, and he is leaving it that way.<br><br>We live in Paris in a little white house which is as tall and narrow as a chimney; behind it we have a little garden with our own chestnut tree and a small fountain for the pigeons and sparrows to bathe in. Just as you&#x2019;ve supposed, we are living happily ever after. In other words, to put it in a manner much more � la mode, I have made, toward living in a foreign country, a &#x201c;very good adjustment.&#x201d; However, I&#x2019;ve had my adventures, I can tell you, and if you&#x2019;ll just turn the page, you&#x2019;ll learn all about them.<br><br>I was definitely under surveillance<br><br>2<br><br>When I set about to marry Pierre, I encountered French law for the first time, and, behind it, a kind of exactness and foresight which makes American law seem positively na�ve and unimaginative.<br><br>When I met Pierre for the first time, in April, 1953, I was, as you know, a three-quarter divorc�e. And when he followed me back to the States that summer, I became, as August passed, and as you also know, a full-fledged divorc�e, with all the accruing rights, freedoms and privileges. So thought the state of California. So thought the Federal government of the United States of America. So thought I.<br><br>Two months later, in Paris, as I laid plans to make June out of January, I discovered that the United States might let me, a one-hundred-proof divorc�e, remarry, but the French government wasn&#x2019;t about to. I found I was not under parole, exactly, but I was definitely under surveillance. For the best part of the year following the final decree of divorce, I was expressly forbidden by French law to remarry. I asked why. &#x201c;Just in case,&#x201d; was the reply, &#x201c;of an overly sentimental farewell with the previous husband on the day of the final decree.&#x201d; The period of surveillance is exactly nine months.<br><br>So when I returned to the United States to make Not as a Stranger for Stanley Kramer and United Artists in Hollywood, I explained to my curious friends why they would still have to wait awhile before they could call me Madame.<br><br>Charles Brackett, who had produced To Each His Own, in which I&#x2019;d won my first Oscar, was vastly amused by my predicament, as he&#x2019;d lived in France for some time before becoming one of Hollywood&#x2019;s best producer-writers, and already knew something of French custom and law.<br><br>&#x201c;In France, in the case of twins, which of the twins is regarded as the senior, having primary rights of heredity?&#x201d; he asked me.<br><br>&#x201c;The first to be born,&#x201d; I replied with my American pragmatism.<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; corrected Charlie. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the second born. On the theory that the last to get out was the first to get in.&#x201d;<br><br>My husband&#x2019;s full name is Pierre Paul Galante. If we should ever have twin boys, and name them after their father, and I have them in France, we shall certainly be robbing Peter to pay Paul.<br><br>This sort of precise, but to us Americans somewhat inverse, logic of French law, is true of all sorts of aspects of French life, as I found out when Not as a Stranger was finished and I flew back to France to rejoin Pierre&#x2014;this time, by the way, with my period of surveillance well (and satisfactorily) over, and perfectly free to marry under French law.<br><br>My plane arrived at Orly Field in the late afternoon of December 24, and as I descended the ramp, I found not only Pierre there to greet me, but a foreign representative of United Artists as well&#x2014;the saddest-looking Frenchman I have ever seen.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Miss de Havilland,&#x201d; he said sorrowfully, &#x201c;what a sad time for you to be coming back to France.&#x201d; I hadn&#x2019;t read the papers for days, so I had no idea what national disaster might have taken place during my absence. Blanching, I asked why. &#x201c;Because,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;the French Customs is on strike.&#x201d; At this, thinking of my seven suitcases, I brightened and remarked that I was sorry that the strikers were having problems on Christmas Eve, but I failed to see how a strike among the Customs inspectors could be regarded as a disadvantage to the arriving traveler. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; said the Frenchman, now quite ashen. &#x201c;In France, when the Customs go on strike, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that they refuse to examine your luggage, it means that they examine everything!&#x201d;<br><br>And then, because it was Christmas Eve, the strikers decided to do it the American way after all!</p><h2>Anywhere Farm</h2><p><b><i>For any anywhere farm, here's all that you need: soil and sunshine, some water, a seed.</i></b><br><br>You might think a farm means fields, tractors, and a barnyard full of animals.

Now, after years of importing cheeses, scouring the cheese-producing areas of the world, and setting up cheese counters at gourmet food shops, he's decided to write it all down. Full of passion, knowledge, and an expert's considered opinions the cheese primer tells you everything you need to know about the hundreds of cheeses that have, in the last few years, become available in this country. Region-by-region, he covers all the major cheeses from France, Italy, Switzerland--the top tier of cheese-producing countries--plus the best of Britain, Ireland, Spain, the United States, Austria, Germany, and other countries. Along the way he tells how to pick out a healthy Pont l'Eveque; why to reconsider the noble Fontina for more than just cooking; how to avoid those factory-made chevres; why to seek out the sublime Vacherin Mont d'Or; and how to start exploring--Bleu de Bresse, Cabrales, Crottin de Chavignol, and so on. A complete primer, it includes information on the best ways to store and serve cheese, including which wines to serve alongside them; how to orchestrate a proper cheese course; and the unimportable cheeses to look up when abroad.<p></p><p></p></p><p>If you want a fascinating food book, say <b>Cheese Primer</b>.

The Ceremony<br><br>In the past, invoking God was the most impressive and powerful way of signalling the importance of anything: a battle, the collection of the harvest, the start of work on a new building.<br><br>Weddings were also emphatically religious events. A couple weren't just promising things to one another; they were making a promise in front of a divine being who, on their death, would judge the worth of their efforts. Religions helped us properly recognise the gravity and strangeness of the act of marriage.<br><br>Today, we probably don't see marriage in explicitly religious terms, and this presents us with a conundrum. If we are interested in marriage ceremonies, we have little choice but to use a set of rituals drawn from religion - although their original meanings are liable to leave us cold. We may want to capture the noumenal meaning of getting married, but the only people offering us this possibility wrap it up in a lot of deeply implausible theological speculation.<br><br>Our conundrum is the result of a historical process that we might call 'bad secularisation'. Traditionally, religions did two distinctive things. On the one hand, they preached ideas about life after death and the creation of the cosmos. On the other hand, they provided potent rituals for marking the great events of our lives. They continually invited us into noumenal time: in baptism, in marriage, at funerals, on certain special holy days. They commissioned art and architecture specifically designed to take us out of the present moment and to give us a perspective on our existence as a whole.<br><br>Secularism proceeded by disputing the big theological claims. But at the same time - and without thinking about it very much - secularism also stripped away the psychologically helpful rituals that happened to have become embedded in the faiths. When secularism threw away the bathwater of theology it threw away the baby of ceremony. It supposed that because religions had been the guardians of ceremony, we couldn't any longer need or legitimately want profound and elevated rituals to help us at the great moments of our lives. But at its heart, ceremony isn't essentially tied to religious faith; noumenal time - in which we see our lives as a whole - doesn't have to rely on convictions about God speaking to Moses or the soul surviving the death of the body.<br><br>The task of good secularisation is to steal from the ceremonial techniques of religions while disregarding their explicit theological content. Religions have intermittently been the holders of many genuinely helpful, creative, interesting and wise ideas that shouldn't be left only to those who happen to believe in the surrounding theology. The priority is to rescue what is still inspiring and relevant from all that is no longer easy to believe.<br><br>In this book, we will describe in detail a wedding ceremony that uses unusual language, special actions and peculiar rituals to place it outside phenomenal time, in order to help us enter the noumenal space of a life-changing event. Crucially, it contains no theology. The ceremony seeks to learn the underlying insight of religion without leaning on its superstitions. We believe that a wedding should use unfamiliar words; it should (ideally) be in a building that speaks of eternity; the celebrant should be a little imposing; we should wear clothes distinct from our normal attire; we should admit our failings and grasp the failings of the other (and yet still both be willing to share a life). We should, in short, be reminded that we are doing something out of the ordinary, which is at once potentially very good for us, for society and for future generations, yet genuinely terrifying and grave as well.</p><h2>Aunt Dimity&#39;s Christmas</h2><p><b>The fifth installment in the bestselling and beloved Aunt Dimity series. Watch out for Nancy Atherton's latest,&nbsp;<i>Aunt Dimity and the King's Ransom</i>, coming in&nbsp;July 2018&nbsp;from Viking!</b><br><br>Lori can hardly wait for Christmas this year: lean times are over, the cottage Aunt Dimity willed her is more beautiful than ever, her nine-month-old twins, Will and Rob, are thriving, and she and husband Bill have never been happier. Determined to make this Christmas the best ever, Lori embarks on a round of shopping, holly-cutting, angel-cookie making, and more. When fat snow flakes begin drifting down outside of the window, Lori feels all her holiday wishes are about to come true. But the next day, beneath the lilac bushes now covered by freshly fallen snow, Lori makes a disturbing discovery: the body of a mysterious stranger--a tramp--barely alive.&nbsp;<br><br>While the nearby village of Finch continues with its seasonal preparations, including rehearsals for the Christmas Eve Nativity play, Lori puts her plans on hold and teams up with Julian Bright--a devilishly attractive Roman Catholic priest--to search out the stranger's identity. Their journey takes them from abandoned World War II airfields to homeless shelters, places where the Christmas star shines dimly, if at all. As Lori unveils the tragic secret that led the stranger to her door, she confronts painful truths about herself and discovers the real meaning of a perfect family Christmas.</p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of twenty-two Aunt Dimity Mysteries. The first book in the series,&nbsp;<i>Aunt Dimity's Death</i>, was voted "One of the Century's 100 Favorite Mysteries" by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.Lori Shepherd lives in England, in the village of Finch, with husband Bill and nine-month twins. She owns her pretty cottage and a considerable fortune besidesa legacy from her mother's long-dead friend Dimity Westwood, who still gives advice and support via ghostly writing in a blue leather journal (Aunt Dimity Digs In, 1998, etc.). Christmas is near and Lori is deep in elaborate preparations when, one snowy morning, a man is found on the ground outsideskeletal, shabbily dressed, and barely alive. Airlifted to the nearest hospital, he shows few signs of recovery, but Lori is intrigued, not to say obsessed, by the mystery of his appearance and is determined to ferret out his identity. Her interest is shared by Father Julian Bright, a local priest who runs St. Benedict's Homeless Shelter. Christmas plans take a back seat as Lori and Julian track their quarry back through a series of men's sheltersall near WWII bomber bases. What is the connection to the war medals and ribbons found with the derelict? Finally, research helpers bring Julian and Lori to London and the home of Lady Haverford, daughter of bomber hero Sir Miles Anscombe and sister of Christopher, the ailing tramp. She refuses to help her brother and accuses him of having driven their father to suicide. Back in Finch, Lori finds that her neighbors have done all the work for her Christmas party and that Aunt Dimity is eager to provide answers to all her unanswered questions, leaving Lori to contemplate some major changes in her own life. Interesting ideas narrated in a bright, literate style, but burdened by much treacly preaching and an obsession that remains unconvincing throughout. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Instead of sticking to the &#34;grunge pop&#34; formula that made Nevermind so palatable to the mainstream, Nirvana chose instead to challenge their audience, producing an album that the band&#39;s creative force, Kurt Cobain, said truly matched his vision of what he had always wanted his band to sound like. Here, the full story behind the creation of In Utero is told for the first time.</p><p><p>Gillian G.

She lives in Seattle.</p>The record was replete with references to babies, childbirth, and reproduction (the album&#x2019;s very title means "in the womb"); witch hunts, the loss of privacy, illness and disease, and ambivalence about fame. The songs expressed a heartfelt anguish that would later cause some to interpret the entire album as a cry for help, but even at the time of its release <i>In Utero</i> could easily be read as an album focused on physical and spiritual sickness. Rather than being overwhelmed by circumstances, however, Cobain&#x2019;s songs on <i>In Utero</i> show him &#x2013; for the most part &#x2013; still able and willing to fight back. As such, among Nirvana&#x2019;s recorded efforts, it stands as Cobain&#x2019;s most personal work.</p><h2>Deliverance from Fat &amp; Eating Disorders (Power for Deliverance Series)</h2><p>Why have so many people not had success in losing unwanted weight? Can weight gain sometimes be unnatural - even supernatural? Could anorexia be linked to a spirit of suicide by starvation? Might bulimia, compulsive eating and food addictions have a common root cause? Most overweight people have no real idea why they overeat, and often live in continual condemnation for not having sufficient will power or self-discipline to control their eating habits. Many feel rejected, or that they are unattractive. Bill Banks presents many unsuspected roots underlying overweight conditions, as well as roots underlying anorexia and bulimia. Dozens of causes for overeating are disclosed. There is a solution to overeating and excess weight, and it is as old as the ministry of Jesus Christ!

Kathleen O&#39;Connor shows that although Jeremiah&#39;s emotionally wrought language can aggravate readers&#39; memories of pain, it also documents the ways an ancient community-and the prophet personally-sought to restore their collapsed social world. Both prophet and book provide a traumatized community language to articulate disaster; move self-understanding from delusional security to identity as survivors; constitute individuals as responsible moral agents; portray God as equally afflicted by disaster; and invite a reconstruction of reality.</p><p>Kathleen M.

Influenced by the Dada movement, her lusterware pottery, with its rich and decadent palette of shimmering gold and silver, vindian greens, incandescent pinks, and intense purples, has captivated generations of collectors. Gilded Vessel is not so much a biography as a celebration of the life and ceramic artistry of Beatrice Wood. Glorious color pictures reveal the iridescent beauty of her pottery, while black-and-white photographs document the life, loves and luster, of a woman New York Times Magazine hailed as one of the great lives of the 20th century.</p><p>Garth Clark a historian and patron of the arts, has written more than 20 books. His 18-year friendship with Beatrice Wood began in 1980, when he interviewed her for his American Potters: Twelve Modern Masters.

Volume 2: Unfashionable Observations, translated by Richard T. Gray, was published in 1995. The edition is a new English translation, by various hands, of the celebrated Colli-Montinari edition, which has been acclaimed as one of the most important works of scholarship in the humanities in the last quarter century. The original Italian edition was simultaneously published in French, German, and Japanese.</p><br><p>This volume of Human, All Too Human, the first of two parts, is the earliest of Nietzsche&#x2019;s works in which his philosophical concerns and methodologies can be glimpsed. In this work Nietzsche began to establish the intellectual difference from his own cultural milieu and time that makes him our contemporary. Published in 1878, it marks both a stylistic and an intellectual shift away from Nietzsche&#x2019;s own youthful affiliation with Romantic excesses of German thought and culture typified by Wagnerian opera.</p></p><p>"The Colli-Montinari edition has revolutionized our understanding of one of the greatest German thinkers. As a result of the new view opened up by this edition, Nietzsche has clearly come into his own as one of the more important philosophers of modern times. The English-language edition should become a classic that will be used by generations of scholars." (David E. Wellbery <i>The Johns Hopkins University</i>)<br><br>"The Colli-Montinari critical edition of Nietzsche's works is one of the most important works of scholarship in the humanities in the last quarter century. It was not until after World War II that one began to realize the extent to which Nietzsche's notebooks had been tampered with, jumbled, badly deciphered, and poorly edited, and it was not until the Colli-Montinari edition that scholars could be confident for the first time of having a trustworthy text."

Harvey <i>Stanford University</i>)</p><h2>Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder</h2><p>Filled with contemporary and classic case studies, this fascinating overview of both serial and mass murder illustrates the many violent expressions of power, revenge, terror, greed, and loyalty.

Queer Strategies for Resisting Assimilation</h2><p>As the gay mainstream prioritizes the attainment of straight privilege over all else, it drains queer identity of any meaning, relevance, or cultural value, writes Matt Bernstein Sycamore, aka Mattilda, editor of <i>That's Revolting!</i>. This timely collection of essays by writers such as Patrick Califia, Kate Bornstein, Carol Queen, Charlie Anders, Benjamin Shepard, and others shows what the new queer resistance looks like. Intended as a fistful of rocks to throw at the glass house of Gaylandia, the book challenges the commercialized, commoditized, and hyper objectified view of gay/queer identity projected by the mainstream (straight and gay) media by exploring queer struggles to transform gender, revolutionize sexuality, and build community/family outside of traditional models. Essays include "Dr. Laura, Sit on My Face," "Gay Art Guerrillas," "Legalized Sodomy Is Political Foreplay," and "Queer Parents: An Oxymoron or Just Plain Moronic?"</p><p>Mattilda&#39; a.k.a.

At this time Pissarro, like Monet, started to work on canvases in series, ofthen pointing several simultaneously and discarding one temporarily when the light, the weather or his mood altered. He started all of them at the scene and worked with extraordinary speed and deftness. In this book, the authors set Pissarro&#39;s cityscapes in their broad art-historical context, looking also at contemporary treatments of the urban scene by Vuillard, Bonnard and Toulouse-Lautrec. Using Pissarro&#39;s extensive correspondence from this period, they reveal the artist&#39;s own attitude towards his final works. The book includes a catatogue of Pissarro&#39;s urban series, each one introduced by an overview covering the history of the cityscape pictured and the production, exhibition history and early critical reception of the series. This book is the catalogue for an exhibition of Pissarro&#39;s cityscape paintings at the Dallas Museum of Art (November 15, 1992 - January 31, 1993). The exhibition will then be shown at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from March 7 to June 6, 1993 and at the Royal Academy in London from July 2 to October 10, 1993.</p><p>The catalog of an exhibition traveling to Dallas, Philadelphia, and London in 1992-93, this book considers approximately 150 paintings done by Pissarro (1830-1903) in the last decade of his life. These paintings are repeated meditations on various motifs in Paris, Rouen, Dieppe, and Le Havre. Brettell (director, Dallas Museum of Art) places Pissarro in the urban view-painting tradition, while Joachim Pissarro, a descendant of the artist, relates these pictures to the artist's development and attempts to understand his intent in painting series. Graced by beautiful plates, this book is appropriate for both lay readers and specialists.<br><i>- Jack Perry Brown, Art Inst. of Chicago Lib.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Selected Poetry of Lord Byron (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>Poet, celebrity, and revolutionary, Lord (George Gordon) Byron was one of the most influential and controversial figures of the first half of the nineteenth century, his distinctive, deeply felt work comprising one of the enduring high points of Romantic literature.

He liked to wear kilts, but he wasn't a Scotsman. He graduated from medical school, but he never made a living at it. He designed spectacular courses, but he was not a good golfer. At the height of his career he was one of the most sought after designers in the world, but he was nearly broke when he died. <p>The Life and Work of Dr. Alister MacKenzie by Tom Doak, James S. Scott and Raymund M Haddock, uses detailed text, color photos and vintage maps, drawings and pictures to bring together many pieces of the puzzle. Questions about his boyhood, his military service, his many design trips in various parts of the world, and what made him so good at his craft, are all answered. Golfers, golf historians, and students of golf course architecture will find this book to be among their favorites. And, why wouldn't they with Augusta National, Cypress Point, Royal Melbourne, Crystal Downs, Lahinch, and Pasatiempo among his magnificent works?</p> <p>The Life and Work of Dr. Alister MacKenzie is a cherished biography on one of golf's most eccentric, interesting, brilliant and colorful characters.</p></p><p><b>TOM DOAK</b> has designed twelve golf courses of his own, most recently Pacific Dunes in Oregon, of which even Alister MacKenzie would have been proud. He is also the author of two previous books: The Anatomy of a Golf Course, a primer on course design; and The Confidential Guide to Golf Courses, a personal review of more than 1,000 courses worldwide. His company, Renaissance Golf Design, is based in Traverse City, Michigan. <p><b>JAMES S. SCOTT</b>. Born and bred in western Scotland, he first worked as a cabin boy on a tramp steamer playing between Ayr and the Baltic. This gave him a bizarre introduction to the game of golf. The ship&#x2019;s captain, while in Scottish port, acquired buckets of damaged golf balls for a few pennies from urchins who scavenged them from Troon or Prestwick. At sea, one of Scott&#x2019;s duties was to tee up a succession of these balls on the foredeck&#x2014;no easy task on a stormy day&#x2014;so the &#x201c;skipper&#x201d; could work off his lunch by driving them into the northern seas. Later, successive exposures to farming, forestry, and fishing were followed by studying medicine. Training and experience were acquired in Glasgow, Dublin, West Africa, London, Liverpool, Chicago, Australia, and Florida. From 1961, he was Chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Leeds University and, from 1986 until retirement, also Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. Then Herbert Warren Wind, at that time Golf Correspondent for <i>The New Yorker</i>, presented Scott with a copy of Alister MacKenzie&#x2019;s <i>Golf Architecture</i> and encouraged him to look into the life of the author, a Leed&#x2019;s graduate, famous in U.S. golfing circles but forgotten in his own &#x201c;alma mater.&#x201d; He lives in Yorkshire, England.</p> <p><b>RAYMUND M. HADDOCK</b> is the stepgrandson of Alister MacKenzie. In 1994, he discovered a manuscript that his stepgrandfather had written in the early 1930s in which he related many of his thoughts about golf and golf course architecture. The book, entitles The Spirit of St. Andrews, was published a year later. A self-described &#x201c;bogey golfer,&#x201d; Ray has played MacKenzie courses in England, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and America. He lives in Boulder, Colorado.</p></p><h2>Introducing Cicero: A Latin Reader (Latin Texts)</h2><p><p>This anthology is designed to meet the needs of Latin students today, acknowledging present constraints on their study-time. It adopts the authors' approach of their "Ecce Romani" series. To enable students to read Latin reasonably quickly, generous assistance is given with vocabulary and explanatory notes placed next to the Latin text. The meaning of difficult sentences and phrases is usually explained by literal translation rather than complex grammatical explanation, though reference is frequently made to the authors' modern grammar book "The Latin Language". An 'overview' technique helps students unravel complex sentences. Extracts are drawn from Cicero's speeches, letters and philosophical writings, thus illustrating his mastery of styles.

Novelist Amos Oz and historian Fania Oz-Salzberger roam the gamut of Jewish history to explain the integral relationship of Jews and words. Through a blend of storytelling and scholarship, conversation and argument, father and daughter tell the tales behind Judaism&#x2019;s most enduring names, adages, disputes, texts, and quips. These words, they argue, compose the chain connecting Abraham with the Jews of every subsequent generation.<br><br> Framing the discussion within such topics as continuity, women, timelessness, and individualism, Oz and Oz-Salzberger deftly engage Jewish personalities across the ages, from the unnamed, possibly female author of the Song of Songs through obscure Talmudists to contemporary writers. They suggest that Jewish continuity, even Jewish uniqueness, depends not on central places, monuments, heroic personalities, or rituals but rather on written words and an ongoing debate between the generations. Full of learning, lyricism, and humor, <i>Jews and Words</i> offers an extraordinary tour of the words at the heart of Jewish culture and extends a hand to the reader, any reader, to join the conversation.</p></p><p><p>An excerpt from<i> Jews and Words</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jewish continuity always hinged on uttered and written words, on an expanding maze of interpretations, debates, and disagreements, and on a unique human rapport.

There is a tangible sense in which Abraham and Sarah, Rabban Gamliel, Glickel of Hameln, and the present authors all belong to the same family tree. Such continuity has recently been disputed: there was no such thing as "Jewish nation," we are told, before modern ideologues deviously dreamed it up. Well, we disagree. Not because we are nationalists. One purpose of this book is to reclaim our ancestry, but also to explain what kind of ancestry, in our view, is worth the effort of reclaiming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are not about stones, clans, or chromosomes. You don't have to be an archeologist, an anthropologist, or a geneticist to trace and substantiate the Jewish continuum. You don't have to be an observant Jew. You don't have to be a Jew.

This book describes the most important known methods for solving the graph-processing problems that arise in practice. Its primary aim is to make these methods and the basic principles behind them accessible to the growing number of people in need of knowing them. The material is developed from first principles, starting with basic information and working through classical methods up through modern techniques that are still under development. Carefully chosen examples, detailed figures, and complete implementations supplement thorough descriptions of algorithms and applications.</p> <p><b>Algorithms</b></p> <p>This book is the second of three volumes that are intended to survey the most important computer algorithms in use today. The first volume (Parts 1-4) covers fundamental concepts (Part 1), data structures (Part 2), sorting algorithms (Part 3), and searching algorithms (Part 4); this volume (Part 5) covers graphs and graph algorithms; and the (yet to be published) third volume (Parts 6-8) covers strings (Part 6), computational geometry (Part 7), and advanced algorithms and applications (Part 8). </p> <p>The books are useful as texts early in the computer science curriculum, after students have acquired basic programming skills and familiarity with computer systems, but before they have taken specialized courses in advanced areas of computer science or computer applications. The books also are useful for self-study or as a reference for people engaged in the development of computer systems or applications programs because they contain implementations of useful algorithms and detailed information on these algorithms' performance characteristics. The broad perspective taken makes the series an appropriate introduction to the field. </p> <p>Together the three volumes comprise the Third Edition of a book that has been widely used by students and programmers around the world for many years. I have completely rewritten the text for this edition, and I have added thousands of new exercises, hundreds of new figures, dozens of new programs, and detailed commentary on all the figures and programs. This new material provides both coverage of new topics and fuller explanations of many of the classic algorithms. A new emphasis on abstract data types throughout the books makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant in modern object-oriented programming environments. People who have read previous editions will find a wealth of new information throughout; all readers will find a wealth of pedagogical material that provides effective access to essential concepts. </p> <p>These books are not just for programmers and computer science students. Everyone who uses a computer wants it to run faster or to solve larger problems. The algorithms that we consider represent a body of knowledge developed during the last 50 years that is the basis for the efficient use of the computer for a broad variety of applications. From N-body simulation problems in physics to genetic-sequencing problems in molecular biology, the basic methods described here have become essential in scientific research; and from database systems to Internet search engines, they have become essential parts of modern software systems. As the scope of computer applications becomes more widespread, so grows the impact of basic algorithms. The goal of this book is to serve as a resource so that students and professionals can know and make intelligent use of graph algorithms as the need arises in whatever computer application they might undertake.</p> <p><b>Scope</b></p> <p>This book, <i>Algorithms in Java, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms,</i> contains six chapters that cover graph properties and types, graph search, directed graphs, minimal spanning trees, shortest paths, and networks. The descriptions here are intended to give readers an understanding of the basic properties of as broad a range of fundamental graph algorithms as possible. </p> <p>You will most appreciate the material here if you have had a course covering basic principles of algorithm design and analysis and programming experience in a high-level language such as Java, C++, or C. <i>Algorithms in Java, Third Edition, Parts 1-4, </i>is certainly adequate preparation. This volume assumes basic knowledge about arrays, linked lists, and abstract data types (ADTs) and makes use of priority-queue, symbol-table, and union-find ADTs--all of which are described in detail in Parts 1-4 (and in many other introductory texts on algorithms and data structures). </p> <p>Basic properties of graphs and graph algorithms are developed from first principles, but full understanding often can lead to deep and difficult mathematics. Although the discussion of advanced mathematical concepts is brief, general, and descriptive, you certainly need a higher level of mathematical maturity to appreciate graph algorithms than you do for the topics in Parts 1-4. Still, readers at various levels of mathematical maturity will be able to profit from this book. The topic dictates this approach: Some elementary graph algorithms that should be understood and used by everyone differ only slightly from some advanced algorithms that are not understood by anyone. The primary intent here is to place important algorithms in context with other methods throughout the book, not to teach all of the mathematical material. But the rigorous treatment demanded by good mathematics often leads us to good programs, so I have tried to provide a balance between the formal treatment favored by theoreticians and the coverage needed by practitioners, without sacrificing rigor.</p> <p><b>Use in the Curriculum</b></p> <p>There is a great deal of flexibility in how the material here can be taught, depending on the taste of the instructor and the preparation of the students. There is sufficient coverage of basic material for the book to be used to teach data structures to beginners, and there is sufficient detail and coverage of advanced material for the book to be used to teach the design and analysis of algorithms to upper-level students. Some instructors may wish to emphasize implementations and practical concerns; others may wish to emphasize analysis and theoretical concepts.</p> <p>For a more comprehensive course, this book is also available in a special bundle with Parts 1-4; thereby instructors can cover fundamentals, data structures, sorting, searching, and graph algorithms in one consistent style.</p> <p>The exercises--nearly all of which are new to this third edition--fall into several types. Some are intended to test understanding of material in the text, and simply ask readers to work through an example or to apply concepts described in the text. Others involve implementing and putting together the algorithms, or running empirical studies to compare variants of the algorithms and to learn their properties. Still others are a repository for important information at a level of detail that is not appropriate for the text. Reading and thinking about the exercises will pay dividends for every reader.</p> <p><b>Algorithms of Practical Use</b></p> <p>Anyone wanting to use a computer more effectively can use this book for reference or for self-study. People with programming experience can find information on specific topics throughout the book. To a large extent, you can read the individual chapters in the book independently of the others, although, in some cases, algorithms in one chapter make use of methods from a previous chapter.</p> <p>The orientation of the book is to study algorithms likely to be of practical use. The book provides information about the tools of the trade to the point that readers can confidently implement, debug, and put algorithms to work to solve a problem or to provide functionality in an application. Full implementations of the methods discussed are included, as are descriptions of the operations of these programs on a consistent set of examples.</p> <p>Because we work with real code, rather than write pseudo-code, you can put the programs to practical use quickly. Program listings are available from the book's home page. You can use these working programs in many ways to help you study algorithms. Read them to check your understanding of the details of an algorithm, or to see one way to handle initializations, boundary conditions, and other situations that pose programming challenges. Run them to see the algorithms in action, to study performance empirically and check your results against the tables in the book, or to try your own modifications. </p> <p>Indeed, one practical application of the algorithms has been to produce the hundreds of figures throughout the book. Many algorithms are brought to light on an intuitive level through the visual dimension provided by these figures.</p> <p>Characteristics of the algorithms and of the situations in which they might be useful are discussed in detail. Connections to the analysis of algorithms and theoretical computer science are developed in context. When appropriate, empirical and analytic results are presented to illustrate why certain algorithms are preferred. When interesting, the relationship of the practical algorithms being discussed to purely theoretical results is described. Specific information on performance characteristics of algorithms and implementations is synthesized, encapsulated, and discussed throughout the book.</p> <p><b>Programming Language</b></p> <p>The programming language used for all of the implementations is Java. The programs use a wide range of standard Java idioms, and the text includes concise descriptions of each construct.</p> <p>Mike Schidlowsky and I developed a style of Java programming based on ADTs that we feel is an effective way to present the algorithms and data structures as real programs. We have striven for elegant, compact, efficient, and portable implementations. The style is consistent whenever possible, so programs that are similar look similar.</p> <p>A goal of this book is to present the algorithms in as simple and direct a form as possible. For many of the algorithms, the similarities remain regardless of which language is used: Dijkstra's algorithm (to pick one prominent example) is Dijkstra's algorithm, whether expressed in Algol-60, Basic, Fortran, Smalltalk, Ada, Pascal, C, C++, Modula-3, PostScript, Java, Python, or any of the countless other programming languages and environments in which it has proved to be an effective graph-processing method. On the one hand, our code is informed by experience with implementing algorithms in these and numerous other languages (C and C++ versions of this book are also available); on the other hand, some of the properties of some of these languages are informed by their designers' experience with some of the algorithms and data structures that we consider in this book. In the end, we feel that the code presented in the book both precisely defines the algorithms and is useful in practice.</p> <br> <br> 0201361213P06272003</p><h2>Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise</h2><p>&#x201c;As notable as the book&#x2019;s broad sweep is the author&#x2019;s good-natured, humorous presentation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Physics Today<br></p><p>Manfred Schroeder is a pioneer in the artistic potential of computer graphics, a world-renowned expert in concert hall acoustics, and holder of over 45 patents.

However, most of his philosophical writings could be found only within the personal library of the Bruce Lee estate--until now. <i>The Warrior Within</i> is the most comprehensive volume of these teachings, meant to help you apply Lee's philosophies to your own life. This unique guide reveals such life-affirming secrets as: <ul> <li>Seeing the totality of life and putting things into perspective </li><li>Understanding the concept of Yin and Yang </li><li>Defeating adversity by adapting to circumstances </li><li>Tapping into inner spiritual forces to help shape the future </li></ul> With a foreword by Linda Lee Cadwell and photographs and other memorabilia from Bruce Lee's short but celebrated life, <i>The Warrior Within</i> is an engrossing and easy-to-understand guide to the little-explored world of Bruce Lee. John Little has been identified as "one of the foremost authorities on Bruce Lee in the world" by <i>Black Belt</i> magazine. He edited a three-volume series for the Bruce Lee estate and has written articles for several publications, including <i>Men's Fitness, Official Karate</i>, and <i>Inside Kung Fu</i>.</p><p>John Little is uniquely suited to the task of relating the philosophy of Bruce Lee and his approach to life. Little has a degree in philosophy from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, is the author of two books on health and fitness (having spent over fifteen years as a writer for several fitness magazines), and is himself a student of Lee&#39;s art of jeet kune do. Selected by the Bruce Lee estate, Little is the only person who has ever been authorized to review the entirety of Lee&#39;s personal notes, sketches, and reading annotations and to edit books on the subject of Lee&#39;s martial art and its far-reaching philosophical underpinnings. Little&#39;s keen awareness of the subtleties of both Eastern and Western philosophy coupled with a respect for the preservation of the essence of Lee&#39;s words and meaning give this book an integrity that is all too rare.While Bruce Lee is generally thought of as a martial arts specialist who made movies and at 33 died under mysterious circumstances, his public perception does not usually include that of a master philosopher. Little (Precision Training: The New Method To Achieve Optimum Muscularity, Power Factor Pub., 1995) attempts to remedy that in this compelling and interesting book, written with the blessing of Lee's estate. A student of Lee's "jeet kune do" form of martial art, Little was given access to heretofore unreleased personal notes, sketches, and reading annotations. What is revealed is a man who read extensively and was well versed in the philosophies of both East and West. Little arranges his narrative under such headings as "See the Totality," "Defeating Adversity," and "The Warrior Within." There is also an excerpt from an interview Little conducted with the late Brandon Lee (Bruce's son), as well as appendixes detailing Lee's principal works and a chronology of his life. While not an essential purchase, it is a worthwhile addition to public library collections.?David M. Turkalo, Suffolk Univ.

In a sweeping analytical narrative spanning the sixteenth century to today, John Tutino challenges our basic assumptions about the forces that shaped global capitalism&#x2015;setting families and communities at the center of histories that transformed the world.</p><p>Despite invasion, disease, and depopulation, Mexico&#x2019;s heartland communities held strong on the land, adapting to sustain and shape the dynamic silver capitalism so pivotal to Spain&#x2019;s empire and world trade for centuries after 1550. They joined in insurgencies that brought the collapse of silver and other key global trades after 1810 as Mexico became a nation, then struggled to keep land and self-rule in the face of liberal national projects. They drove Zapata&#x2019;s 1910 revolution&#x2015;a rising that rattled Mexico and the world of industrial capitalism. Although the revolt faced defeat, adamant communities forced a land reform that put them at the center of Mexico&#x2019;s experiment in national capitalism after 1920. Then, from the 1950s, population growth and technical innovations drove people from rural communities to a metropolis spreading across the land. The heartland urbanized, leaving people searching for new lives&#x2015;dependent, often desperate, yet still pressing their needs in a globalizing world.</p><p>A masterful work of scholarship, <i>The Mexican Heartland</i> is the story of how landed communities and families around Mexico City sustained silver capitalism, challenged industrial capitalism&#x2015;and now struggle under globalizing urban capitalism.</p></p><p><p>"In this local history of global capitalism, Tutino's Braudelian vision brings the Mexican heartland to life, a small place that changed world history. Taking us through five hundred years of history--from Moctezuma to Vicente Fox--the book excels at showing how the interactions of imperial conquerors, peasants, nation-building bureaucrats, capitalists, and workers created the revolution of capitalism, and how, at the same time, the least powerful often succeeded in maintaining surprising degrees of local autonomy. A must-read for anyone interested in the history of capitalism."<b>--Sven Beckert, author of <i>Empire of Cotton: A Global History</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Mexican Heartland</i> is a wonderful realization of the injunction to research locally and conceptualize globally. Examining centuries of digging and plowing in rural communities around Mexico City, Tutino once again confirms his stature as a scholar who can capture the whole of social relations in the smallest detail of daily life. A tour de force."<b>--Greg Grandin, author of <i>The Empire of Necessity; Fordlandia;</i> and <i>The Last Colonial Massacre</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Mexican Heartland</i> is an excellent book. Tutino combines a big, systemic picture of structural change with an understanding of how people at the grass roots accommodated, protested, and altered those structures. His argument is convincing and important."<b>--Kenneth Pomeranz, author of <i>The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy</i></b></p><p>"A major contribution. <i>The Mexican Heartland</i> is a passionate and powerfully told story of capitalism's role in shaping what Mexico is today."<b>--Margaret Chowning, author of <i>Rebellious Nuns: The Troubled History of a Mexican Convent, 1752&#x2013;1863</i></b></p><p>"This is a deeply ambitious book with a highly consequential argument.

She lives in Kingston, New York. <p>""From the Hardcover edition.""</p>Ages 5-7. The text of this picture book is Eugene Field's poem "The Duel," in which the gingham dog and the calico cat have an all-night battle--"The old Dutch clock, it told me so, / And that is how I came to know"--that ends with the two eating each other up. The softly shaded pencil drawings are so light in tone that it's sometimes hard to gain depth perception or to make out exactly what is going on, particularly in the battle scenes or when patterns and shadows overlap; however, Westerman handles the draftsmanship and the characterization of inanimate objects with finesse, and this is an acceptable choice for libraries with demand for traditional poems in picture-book format. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Tools of the Earth</h2><p>The author shares his thoughts on gardening, discusses techniques for composting and midnight slug trapping, and highlights commonly used garden tools, exploring each one&#39;s history and use</p><p>Like Jeff Taylor's earlier book, <i>Tools of the Trade</i>, this book offers a lyrical glimpse in each chapter at one commonly used implement--in this case, those used in gardening (wheelbarrow, hoe, auger, hammock, etc.). Along with lovely photographs by Rich Iwasaki, it relates a personal description, story, or ode to each particular item. As in his earlier work, the author's writing is often quite funny (there's a chapter about the author's misadventures with a wheelbarrow), sometimes moving, very personal, and very entertaining for gardeners and nongardeners alike. A little history, a little storytelling, and another delight from Jeff Taylor. <i>--Mark A. Hetts</i>'Tools of the Earth,' by Jeff Taylor, isnt really about gardening either but is a witty book on garden tools (his wife's a gardener).

'The Tools of the Earth' cleverly braids essays about garden work around the tools he uses. All the important implements see action: trowel, hoe, gloves, loppers, rake, bucket. Bucket: Will a bucket carry an essay? Much can be made of little if you have the will and capacity to concentrate the vapors of ordinary life. Taylor manages this task well. 'If you don't enjoy the simple pleasure of hoeing, you'll avoid doing it early, which means you'll have to do it later, and thereby, have more and taller weeds, but much less fun,' Taylor writes. He also includes the hammock among his critical wares. 'Of all the tools of the earth, of all the things we use to till, seed, shape, water, harrow, rake, weed and harvest our happy gardens, the hammock is the only one that will make us feel better immediately,'' Taylor writes. Of all the raised beds in the garden, only the hammock cures fatigue.' -- <i>Kitchen Garden</i><br><br>Composting, Well, Philosophically <p>"The attraction of Jeff Taylor's new book, 'Tools of the Earth: The Practice and Pleasure of Gardening,' is that it appears to be a sequel to his previous book, 'Tools of the Trade: The Art and Craft of Carpentry,' which told you more than you were likely to know about the hammer, the handsaw and other basic tools, and pleasantly less than you wanted to know..." -- <i>New York Times</i></p></p><h2>Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge: The Book of Mnemonic Devices</h2><p>When is a "tulip"* not a flower?

As a modern application developer you need to understand the emerging field of data management, both RDBMS and NoSQL. <i>Seven Databases in Seven Weeks</i> takes you on a tour of some of the hottest open source databases today. In the tradition of Bruce A. Tate's <i>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</i>, this book goes beyond your basic tutorial to explore the essential concepts at the core each technology.<br><br>Redis, Neo4J, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, Riak and Postgres. With each database, you'll tackle a real-world data problem that highlights the concepts and features that make it shine. You'll explore the five data models employed by these databases-relational, key/value, columnar, document and graph-and which kinds of problems are best suited to each.<br><br>You'll learn how MongoDB and CouchDB are strikingly different, and discover the Dynamo heritage at the heart of Riak. Make your applications faster with Redis and more connected with Neo4J. Use MapReduce to solve Big Data problems. Build clusters of servers using scalable services like Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).<br><br>Discover the CAP theorem and its implications for your distributed data. Understand the tradeoffs between consistency and availability, and when you can use them to your advantage. Use multiple databases in concert to create a platform that's more than the sum of its parts, or find one that meets all your needs at once. <br><br><i>Seven Databases in Seven Weeks</i> will take you on a deep dive into each of the databases, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to choose the ones that fit your needs.<br><br><b>What You Need:</b><br><br>To get the most of of this book you'll have to follow along, and that means you'll need a *nix shell (Mac OSX or Linux preferred, Windows users will need Cygwin), and Java 6 (or greater) and Ruby 1.8.7 (or greater). Each chapter will list the downloads required for that database.</p></p><p><br> <p><b>Q&amp;A with Authors Eric Redmond and Jim Wilson</b></p> <br> <p><b>How did you pick the seven databases?</b></p> <p>Eric: We did have some criteria, if not explicit. The databases had to be open source---we didn't want to cover any databases that would tie readers to a company. We wanted at least one implementation for each of the five database genres (Relational, Key-Value, Columnar, Document, Graph). Then we chose databases that exemplified some general concepts we wanted to cover, like the CAP theorem, or mapreduce. Finally, we chose databases that were good counterpoints to each other--so we chose MongoDB and CouchDB (different ways of implementing document stores). Or we chose Riak because it was a Dynamo (Amazon's database) implementation to compare to HBase as a BigTable (Google's database) implementation.</p> <p>Jim: Our goal with the book was principally to introduce readers to the field of choices they now have. Our selections were largely in service of that goal. Even so, it was a pretty long and iterative process. We knew that no matter which ones we picked there'd be people asking why we did or didn't include their favorite. It came down to choosing the genres we wanted to discuss and then picking databases that had the right combination of (A) representing their genre and (B) relative popularity.</p> <p>For example, we picked PostgreSQL since it sticks very closely to the SQL standard and is relatively less well known than other OSS competitors like MySQL. Similarly, even though both HBase and Cassandra are column-oriented databases, we went with HBase because Cassandra is more of a hybrid that incorporates elements from both the BigTable paper and the Dynamo paper.</p> <br> <p><b>Databases are rapidly changing. What do you wish you&#x2019;d included now?</b></p> <p>Eric: There are hundreds of database options, but I'm glad to see that our choices are still going strong a year later. However, if I had to do it over again, I would like to have added a Triplestore (like Mulgara), since the semantic web is slowly popularizing this method of data storage. I also would have liked to spend more time on Neo4j's Cypher language, or have covered Hadoop in a bit of detail, since analytics is a huge part of data storage.</p> <p>Jim: Yes, databases are rapidly changing, in two senses. First, the field of available data storage technology has been seeing an explosion in recent years. More and more different sorts of databases are cropping up to fill in various niche needs. In the other sense, the databases themselves are rapidly evolving. Even between minor version releases, modern NoSQL databases incorporate more and more features in order to claim more of the market and remain competitive. In that regard, there's a bit of convergence happening and it makes choosing one even harder as there are more that can meet your needs all the time.</p> <p>I still think the five genres and seven databases we chose satisfy the criteria that we set out to achieve. But there are others I'd like to write about as well. These include some old favorites like SQLite and some databases you might not think of as such, like OpenLDAP and SOLR (an inverted index/search engine).</p> <br> <p><b>Why did you decide to write this book?</b></p> <p>Eric: Jim and I discussed writing a book like this for quite some time. About a year and a half ago he sent me an email with no body--the subject was "Seven Databases in Seven Weeks?" The title sold me. We both loved Bruce's "Seven Languages" book, and this seemed the perfect format to explore this emerging field.</p> <p>Jim: As early as March of 2010, Eric and I brainstormed about writing a NoSQL book of some kind. At the time there was a lot of buzz around the term, but also a lot of confusion. We thought we could bring some structure to the discussion and educate people who might not be up to speed yet on all the latest developments.</p> <p>After reading Bruce A. Tate's Seven Languages in Seven Weeks I thought, "What about Seven Databases?" Eric submitted a proposal and a few weeks later we were off to the races.</p> <br> <p><b>What do you see as up and coming databases?</b></p> <p>Eric: I've become a big fan of Neo4j. It's one we covered in the book, but in all honesty we chose it because we wanted to explore an open source graph database. But over the past year it's really come into its own. I really do believe this is the year we'll see wider adoption of graph databases.</p> <p>As for ones we did not cover, I think ElasticSearch is clearly gaining traction. OrientDB is also interesting, as it can act as a relational, key-value, document, or a graph database. I think you'll see more of this multi-genre behavior in the future. And as I hinted at before, Triplestores are gaining a bit of traction, too, though their problem-set greatly overlaps with general graph databases.</p> <p>Jim: There are many, of course, but there are at least two that I personally look forward to exploring in more detail: ElasticSearch and doozer.</p> <p>ElasticSearch is a distributed, peer-based, REST/JSON powered document search engine. Using a distributed Lucene index at its core, ElasticSearch allows REST clients to find documents based on fuzzy criteria. Everyone needs a search engine, and ElasticSearch makes it easy.</p> <p>Doozer is a fast, headless consensus engine. It's written in the Go programming language by the smart folks at Heroku. Doozer is great for storing small blobs of important information that absolutely must be consistent (like cluster configuration metadata), but without a single point of failure.</p><p>Eric Redmond has been in the software industry for more than 15 years, working with Fortune 500 companies, governments, and many startups.

Such individuals are increasingly recognized as suffering from Asperger Syndrome. The argument presented in this book is that they suffer from a form of autism, but that they can compensate for this handicap to a remarkable degree. In this volume the foremost experts in the field discuss the diagnostic criteria of the syndrome, richly illustrated with examples from their clinical practices. Clinical accounts are balanced with personal accounts and some as yet preliminary research data. Asperger&#39;s classic paper is translated and annotated. The insights of this pioneer of autism have been unjustly neglected but reflect a very modern awareness of the many forms of autism and the wide range of individual differences in the men and women who suffer from this disorder. Asperger Syndrome individuals with their intellectual and linguistic ability and their desire for social adaptation are extremely vulnerable.</p><p>The problem of the eccentric individual who appears to be simultaneously intellectually gifted and mentally retarded is addressed as a type of autism defined as Asperger Syndrome in this in-depth analysis of the disorder.Uta Frith provides the English translation of Asperger&#39;s paper, and shows how much adaptation, learning and personal development is possible if there is a sensitive understanding of the precise problems involved.</p><h2>Essential Confucius</h2><p>Confucius is one of the great figures in the history of human thought, a pioneering educator, social critic, and political scientist. As a philosopher and teacher, he addressed core human issues with such precision and clarity that his sayings have been preserved and studied over thousands of years. The Analects of Confucius are a basic source for a wide range of advice on human affairs from governing nations and managing enterprises to dealing with society and getting along with others. This new presentation of the ever-popular sayings of Confucius is designed to bring the wisdom of a great teacher to another generation of readers. In his brilliant text, Thomas Cleary has arranged the sayings of Confucius in the order of the sixty-four classic I Ching hexagrams, which Confucius not only made available in their present form but also supplemented with his own written commentaries. Widely recognized for his linguistic and technical mastery in the translation of ancient Chinese texts, Tho</p><p>Cleary presents the core teachings of the great Chinese philosopher, educator, and social critic in a convenient, easy-to-read format. Sayings from Confucius's <i>Analects</i>, or collection of aphorisms, are arranged in small groups by topic following his commentaries on the <i>I Ching</i>, or <i>Book of Changes</i>, the most profound of the Chinese classics. These remarks, which were incorporated into the <i>I Ching</i> itself, afford, as Cleary says, "the most convenient lens through which to view the ideas of Confucius systematically." This elegant organization makes it simple for the reader to consult the great sage readily on the wide variety of subjects with which he was concerned--including morality, etiquette, diplomacy, and social responsibility. Cleary's translation captures all the simplicity and directness of Confucius's eminently practical approach to life: "Be dutiful at home, brotherly in public; be discreet and trustworthy, love all people, and draw near to humanity. If you have extra energy as you do that, then study literature." The introduction provides solid philosophical and historical background, and notes on each of the 64 sections provide further insight into the subtleties of Confucian wisdom. <i>--Uma Kukathas</i></p><h2>Conversations with Yogananda</h2><p>This is an unparalleled, first-hand account of the teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda, featuringnearly 500 never-before-released stories, sayings, and insights.

The book takes a chronological approach, covering the earliest ancient traditions up through the early and late modern periods and into contemporary theory. It takes an inclusive, interdisciplinary approach to this key concept in aesthetics and criticism, representing voices and traditions that have often been excluded. As such, it will be of use and interest across the humanities and allied disciplines, from art criticism and literary theory, to gender and cultural studies and environmental philosophy.</p><p>The anthology includes brief introductions to each selection, reading or discussion questions, suggestions for further reading, a bibliography and index &#x2013; making it an ideal text for building a course around or for further study.

AP Latin Exams test the proficiency of high school Latin students when compared to college students who have taken a fourth- to sixth-semester Latin course. (Traditionally, one semester of college study has been approximately equivalent to one year of high school study.) If you are reading this book, it is likely that you are among the high-achieving students who either want to demonstrate their facility with the Latin language at the end of their study or who intend to continue studying Latin in college. The focus of this book is to help you to prepare for the AP Latin Exam: to assess and expand not only your general skills of comprehending, translating, and analyzing Latin, but also to help you to understand and appreciate the importance of the ability to write coherently and persuasively in English.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since 1994, there have been two different AP Latin exams available, one that evaluates your knowledge of Vergil&#x2019;s Aeneid and the other, Latin Literature, that assesses your preparation of one of three combinations of authors. Each of the latter exams includes the poems of Catullus, i.e., Catullus-Cicero, Catullus-Horace, and Catullus-Ovid. Both the AP Vergil and the AP Latin Literature exams may be taken in the same year; however, special arrangements need to be made</p><p>with your school to schedule the second exam.2 The specific content and format of both the Vergil and Latin Literature Exams are described in greater detail in succeeding chapters of this book. The scoring of the exam is explained at the end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Format of the AP Latin Exam</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The AP Latin Exam, the format of which was changed in 1999, now consists of two parts: a multiple-choice section (40 percent) and a free-response section (60percent). The multiple-choice section, which is administered fi rst, consists of 50 multiple-choice questions over three sight passages of prose and poetry and one syllabus-based passage, that is, one passage from the lines or poems that you have prepared in Latin. The sight readings of the multiple-choice section are common to the two exams, and the syllabus-based passage comes from either Vergil or Catullus, as appropriate. You have 60 minutes for this part. The free-response section consists of five questions for Vergil and six for Latin Literature, the latter consisting of three on Catullus and three on the choice author Cicero, Horace, or Ovid. These questions, which consist of translations, long and short essays, and discussions of background or short identifications, evaluate your preparation of the assigned syllabus. Those portions of the Aeneid and of Cicero&#x2019;s De Amicitia not prepared in Latin must be read in English. You are given one hour and 45 minutes for the free-response section, plus a 15-minute reading period,&#x201d; during which you may organize your thinking and plan your answers. The total time for the AP Latin Exam is three hours, plus about one-half hour of administrative and break time. Be aware that, periodically, changes are made to the content or format of the AP Latin Exam. <b>For instance, in the Cicero syllabus the Pro Caelio has been replaced for the 2007 exam with the Pro Archia Poeta and selections from the De Amicitia</b> (for specific information, see Chapter 3). Every five years</p><p>or so, the entire AP Latin Exam, both Vergil and Latin Literature, is released and published for reference by students and teachers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Terms Used in AP Latin</b></p></p><h2>Psychedelic Medicine: The Healing Powers of LSD, MDMA, Psilocybin, and Ayahuasca</h2><p>Explores the potential of psychedelics as medicine and the intersections of politics, science, and psychedelics <br><br>� Explores the tumultuous history of psychedelic research, the efforts to restore psychedelic therapies, and the links between psychiatric drugs and mental illness <br><br>� Offers non-technical summaries of the most recent, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and ayahuasca <br><br>� Includes the work of Rick Doblin, Stanislav Grof, James Fadiman, Julie Holland, Dennis McKenna, David Nichols, Charles Grob, Phil Wolfson, Michael and Annie Mithoefer, Roland Griffiths, Katherine MacLean, and Robert Whitaker <br><br>Embracing the revival of psychedelic research and the discovery of new therapeutic uses, clinical psychologist Dr. Richard Louis Miller discusses what is happening today in psychedelic medicine--and what will happen in the future--with top researchers and thinkers in this field, including Rick Doblin, Stanislav Grof, James Fadiman, Julie Holland, Dennis McKenna, David Nichols, Charles Grob, Phil Wolfson, Michael and Annie Mithoefer, Roland Griffiths, Katherine MacLean, and Robert Whitaker. <br><br>Dr. Miller and his contributors cover the tumultuous history of early psychedelic research brought to a halt 50 years ago by the U.S. government as well as offering non-technical summaries of the most recent studies with MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and ayahuasca.

He received his doctorate in public policy from Harvard&#x2019;s Kennedy School of Government, where he wrote his dissertation on the regulation of the medical uses of psychedelics and marijuana. His professional goal is to help develop legal contexts for the beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana, primarily as prescription medicines but also for personal growth for otherwise healthy people, and eventually to become a legally licensed psychedelic therapist.</i> <br><br><b>RLM:</b> Now it's over 25 years from when you started MAPS. Tell us about the research that MAPS is sponsoring in these various psychedelic medicines. <br><br><b>RD:</b> The good news is that there is now more psychedelic research taking place around the world than at any time in the last 40 years. We&#x2019;re basically combining science, politics, and psychedelics. . . . Our resources are limited and we want to do work that will have the biggest appeal to the American public. <br><br><b>Two Phases Down, One More to Approval</b> <br><br><b>RD:</b> We started from what are called Phase I studies--working in a healthy population to evaluate what the drug does--to get a sense of the risk of MDMA, and to get a sense of the potential patients. Phase II is where you can start working with patients, and Phase III are the large-scale, definitive studies. <br><br>We're in the middle of the Phase II stage all over the world--working with patients. The first disorder we have chosen to work with is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People are very sympathetic to those who have been victimized and survived childhood sexual abuse, or adult rape and assault, or particularly now veterans and soldiers with PTSD from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or in Israel, from wars and terrorism all over the world. <br><br>Our primary focus is MDMA, because it's a more gentle psychedelic than the rest. We've actually heard from a lot of people who had difficult psychedelic trips with LSD or psilocybin or mescaline during the &#x2019;60s or &#x2019;70s--during their youth--who have been unable to work through them, and when they smoke marijuana it brings it back. A fair number of people I know don't use marijuana because it brings back difficult psychedelic trips from the past--and we worked with some of these people and have found that MDMA can help them integrate these difficult psychedelic experiences from the past. <br><br>I think MDMA will be the first drug to be integrated into our culture, and I think PTSD is likely to be the first clinical indication. We're seeing lots of support for this. That's why we're being invited to go to the Pentagon to present this proposal. Combining these two directions-- both the politics of drug regulation and also psychotherapy--has led me to conclude that MDMA has an excellent chance of making it through the regulatory system. <br><br><b>Maximizing Benefits and Minimizing Risks of MDMA-Assisted Therapy</b> <br><br><b>RLM:</b> Is there a negative effect of frequent use of MDMA, and what is frequent use? <br><br><b>RD:</b> Every drug has its risks and MDMA is not this magical drug that has no risks. Our model is a male/female co-therapist team in a therapeutic setting. Secondly, it's roughly a 3 1/2-month treatment process. There are initially three weekly, non-drug, 90-minute sessions to build the therapeutic alliance with the therapist and the patients, to come to understand the history of the trauma and how the patient has reacted. <br><br>Then there is an MDMA session, which starts at around 10 AM and goes to 6 PM--an eight-hour session. Then people spend the night in the treatment center. The MDMA sessions are followed by a non-drug therapy session the next day--then phone calls every day for a week, then weekly non-drug psychotherapy for a month. <br><br>The MDMA sessions in our therapeutic setting are three to five weeks apart. In our first study, we did a series of very complicated and expensive neurocognitive studies, because the claim has been that MDMA will reduce serotonin if it's done too frequently or at too high doses, and then people will supposedly have cognitive deficiencies. We tested that and found no evidence at all. In our therapeutic setting, with pure MDMA, spaced out once a month--three times--there's no evidence that it's harmful. <br><br>Now, if people were to do it every other day, I think that would be too frequent. They're looking for a heightened emotionality, deeper feelings of peace and love, and when you just continue to do it too frequently you kind of get muted out in your emotions. You become much more washed out, and drained. <br><br><b>RLM:</b> On the other hand, Rick, I've had patients--couples--who have done it once a week, every single week for up to a year, and they report very beneficial effects. <br><br><b>RD:</b> Yeah. There is so much individual variability. <br><br><b>Integrating the Experience</b> <br><br><b>RD:</b> In terms of frequency, the key part is for me is whether the patient integrated what happened before. I think that's a healthy way to say, &#x201c;Okay, I'm going to have this experience.

This might seem like a daughter's belated rebellion, except that these fierce, rock-strong, deeply felt lyrics are steeled by love and understanding. <p></p></p><p>Louise Gl�ck won the Pulitzer Prize for <em>The Wild Iris</em> in 1993. The author of eight books of poetry and one collection of essays, <em>Proofs and Theories: Essays on Poetry,</em> she has received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry, the William Carlos Williams Award, and the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for Nonfiction. She was named the next U.S. poet laureate in August 2003. Her most recent book is <em>The Seven Ages</em>. Louise Gl�ck teaches at Williams College and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<p></p>In her fifth book since 1968, Gluck writes introspective poems about her mother and sister, her mother's lost child, the death of her father, a family bound by silences, and a need "to make something whole." Family obsessions are offset by a desire for self-understanding: "In my own mind, I'm invisible: that's why I'm dangerous./ People like me, who seem selfless/ . . . should be factored out/ in the interest of truth." Gluck's "powers of language" seem "wasted" because the mind is skewed by the impermanence of love. Still, one reads Gluck's poems to discover how well she can articulate truths of selfhood. More open and personal than her previous work, these poems offer insights that are painful yet tinged with pleasure and clarified by the knowledge that the price of an "act of creation" is loss.<br><i>- Frank Allen, Regents Coll., Albany, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crime Without Borders: An Introduction to International Criminal Justice</h2><p><i>Crime Wthout Borders </i>examines the globalization of crime and justice in today&#x2019;s contemporary society.

The poems address wide-ranging human concerns such as love, motherhood, death, colonial domination, and human dignity. They employ a variety of styles from the conversational to the didactic. Contributors include Ama Ata Aidoo, Noemia de Sousa, Queen Hatshepsut, Micere Githae Mugo, and Zindzi Mandela. </p> <p>Originally from Malawi, Stella and Frank Chipasula now live in the United States. </p></p><p>African dissident poet, Frank Chipasula, has been living in self imposed exile in the USA since 1978.The editors of this haunting anthology of poetry, both African-born poets themselves, have selected work by women poets from 18 African countries, from Algeria to Senegal, Mauritius, and Zimbabwe. This broad geographical and cultural spectrum highlights Africa's considerable diversity while, simultaneously, affirming the shared experiences and perspectives of African women writers. A historical note is struck by the anthology's oldest poem, an obelisk inscription composed by Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt, while a modern Egyptian poet, Andre Chedid, epitomizes the dignity of the collection with her powerfully spare and provocative mediations. Unlike Queen Hatshepsut, most African women suffer tyranny, sexism, and poverty and toil in silence and anonymity. Chedid writes, "Often from a point without place / I stifle my story / From past to future / I conjugate the horizon." For many of these poets, the world is unrelentingly cruel, and they belie their vulnerability with stoicism. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Hunter Gracchus and Other Papers on Literature and Art</h2><p>Collects essays commenting on art, architecture, religion, and literature</p><p>In his 28th book, Davenport the humanist (he is also a novelist, poet, translator, and critic) draws on his knowledge of antiquity and modernism, and many points in between, to travel crablike among the various arts in a consciously miscellaneous essay collection, his third (after Geography of the Imagination, 1981, and Every Force Evolves a Form, 1987). Sent this way and that, seemingly by curiosity or instinct, the writer avoids making academic pronouncements. Unlike so many contemporary literary historians and critics, Davenport writes in order to be understood; his prose is playful, never cryptic. As a consequence, he can lead us into challenging territory--the work of Charles Darwin, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Wallace Stevens, Jean Cocteau--without a fuss, and without losing us. The piece on Darwin, for example, ``Life, Chance, and Charles Darwin,'' seems to be the product of ``untaught'' enthusiasm, in the very best sense. His memoir ``On Reading,'' originally published in Antaeus, and mixing recollections of his studies at Duke, Oxford, and Harvard with a southern autodidact's now affectionate, now scouring independent-mindedness, is a classic. ``The mind is a self- consuming organ and preys on itself,'' Davenport writes. ``It is an organ for taking the outside in.'' The comments in this autobiographical excursion are central to his overall approach as a critic; throughout the book, Davenport sets out to do just as he likes, serving as a masterly sort of common reader, and declining the burden of political correctness. The essay on Stein in particular, ``Late Gertrude,'' returns us to that influential yet neglected literary beacon. Davenport's wry ``occasional'' observations line up jauntily in the fragmentary ``Micrographs'' and in two journal series (e.g., ``Hemingway's prose is like an animal talking. But what animal?''). Only rarely is a note of preciousness sounded. These are the recent explorations of an omnivorous, ideal reader, road maps for the rest of us. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Davenport claims in his introduction that the only "semblance of unity" in his third gathering of "studies, reviews, essays and commentaries" is in their being written on the same typewriter. The Hunter Gracchus does indeed cover a wide array of literary and artistic subjects, ranging from short stories by Kafka to those of Donald Barthelme, from Shaker furniture to Picasso's Guernica. Yet Davenport's approach is anything but varied. Every chapter is made up of a muddle of speculations about artistic influence; beginning with arcane anecdotes and ending in vague superlatives, they rarely support a new idea from the author himself. The implications of the modern utopian Charles Fourier, who appears in at least three different essays, having inspired Marx and Lenin, Le Courbusier and the author himself, are never explored. What matters to Davenport is that these intellectuals and artists have legitimized each other. Reading the book straight through is like listening to a professional musician practicing scales; though Davenport's scholarship is impressive, the overall effect is inconclusive and monotonous. A few of Davenport's abstract journal entries and longer, pensive paragraphs about anything from the Big Bang theory to Sartre's idea of literature provide some diversion but fail to redeem the book as a whole. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Business of Event Planning: Behind-the-Scenes Secrets of Successful Special Events</h2><p><b>Practical tools and expert advice for professional event planners</b> <p>Before planning an event, there is much that must be done behind the scenes to make the event successful.

Three-time Academy Award nominee for best director, responsible for such film classics as <i>A Room with a View </i>and <i>The Remains of the Day, </i>Ivory speaks with remarkable candor and wit about his more than forty years as an independent filmmaker. In this deeply engaging book, he comments on the many aspects of his world-traveling career: his growing up in Oregon (he is not an Englishman, as most Europeans and many Americans think), his early involvement with documentary films that first brought attention to him, his discovery of India, his friendships with celebrated figures here and abroad, his skirmishes with the Picasso family and Thomas Jefferson scholars, his usually candid yet at times explosive relations with actors. Supported by seventy illuminating photographs selected by Ivory himself, the book offers a wealth of previously unavailable information about the director's life and the art of making movies.<br><br>James Ivory on:<br><br>On the Merchant Ivory Jhabvala partnership:<br><br>"I've always said that Merchant Ivory is a bit like the U. S. Govenment; I'm the President, Ismail is the Congress, and Ruth is the Supreme Court. Though Ismail and I disagree sometimes, Ruth acts as a referee, or she and I may gang up on him, or vice versa. The main thing is, no one ever truly interferes in the area of work of the other."<br>On Shooting Mr. and Mrs. Bridge:<br><br>"Who told you we had long 18 hour days? We had a regular schedule, not at all rushed, worked regular hours and had regular two-day weekends, during which the crew shopped in the excellent malls of Kansas City, Paul Newman raced cars somewhere, unknown to us and the insurance company, and I lay on a couch reading The Remains of the Day."<br>On Jessica Tandy as Miss Birdseye in The Bostonians:<br><br>"Jessica Tandy was seventy-two or something, and she felt she had to 'play' being an old woman, to 'act' an old woman. Unfortunately, I'couldn't say to her, 'You don't have to 'act' this, just 'be,' that will be sufficient.' You can't tell the former Blanche Du Bois that she's an old woman now."<br>On Adapting E. M. Forster's novels<br><br>"His was a very pleasing voice, and it was easy to follow. Why turn his books into films unless you want to do that? But I suppose my voice was there, too; it was a kind of duet, you could say, and he provided the melody."<br>On India:<br><br>"If you see my Indian movies then you get some idea of what it was that attracted me about India and Indians...any explanation would sound lamer than the thing warrants. The mood was so great and overwhelming that any explanation of it would seem physically thin....I put all my feeling about India into several Indian films, and if you know those films and like them, you see from these films what it was that attracted me to India."<br>On whether he was influenced by Renoir in filming A Room with a View<br><br>"I was certainly not influenced by Renoir in that film. But if you put some good looking women in long white dresses in a field dotted with red poppies, andthey're holding parasols, then people will say, Renoir.&#x2019;"<br>On the Critics:<br><br>"I came to believe that to have a powerful enemy like Pauline Kael only made me stronger. You know, like a kind of voodoo. I wonder if it worked that way in those days for any of her other victims Woody Allen, for instance, or Stanley Kubrick."<br>On Andy Warhol as a dinner guest:<br><br> I met him many times over the last twenty years of his life, but I can't say I knew him, which is what most people say, even those who were his intimates. Once he came to dinner with a group of his Factory friends at my apartment. I remember that he or someone else left a dirty plate, with chicken bones and knife and fork, in my bathroom wash basin. It seemed to be a symbolic gesture, to be a matter of style, and not just bad manners."</p><p>"From sensitive enfant terrible to playful elder statesman, James Ivory has carried a delicate candle of pure hedonism through the violent decades, sheltering it from every hostile wind which sought to extinguish it. One of the few to whom one can unhesitatingly apply the phrase "citizen of the world," he has spent a lifetime scattering beautiful moments across the continents." Wallace Shawn<br><br> James Ivory is one of our greatest living directors, and these pages, deliciously poised between diplomacy and indiscretion, brim with his vast experience of every nook and cranny of the film world. Offering precious insights into how the cinematic cultures of Europe, Asia and America, of Arthouse and Hollywood, came to be blended into a ravishingly beautiful body of work, Ivory also draws for us a vivid picture of what it really feels like to put together an independent movie. But perhaps most striking is the way this book illuminates the human face of film-making, and becomes a touching testament to the deep friendships - the bonds of trust, affection, professional respect - that have made possible the unique triumph that is Merchant Ivory.&#x201d; Kazuo Ishiguro<br><br> Robert Emmet Long&#x2019;s <i>James Ivory in Conversation</i> transforms what might have been a routine Q &amp; A into a lucid film history told from the unostentatious matter-of-fact viewpoint of that least narcissistic of productive and creative directors, James Ivory, with 25 films to his credit in a career that has spanned more than 40 years. He has become almost inseparably linked with producer Ismail Merchant and screenwriter Ruth Jhabvala to form the most famous collaborative troika in film history. As Mr. Ivory&#x2019;s perceptively assiduous Boswell, Mr. Long deserves much of the credit for the felicitous outcome of the project. This is a must-read for all venturesome cineastes, particularly as a counterweight to all the reverse snobbery heaped upon the troika for succeeding commercially with serious and tasteful literary adaptations into film.&#x201d; Andrew Sarris<b>Robert Emmet Long</b> has written or edited over forty books that reflect an unusual versatility, ranging from works on Henry James to James Thurber, from the films of Ingmar Bergman to the Broadway musicals of Jerome Robbins. His book <i>The Films of Merchant Ivory </i>(1997) is the standard work on the subject. <b>Janet Maslin</b> is film and book critic for the <i>New York Times. </i></p><h2>Foul Perfection: Essays and Criticism</h2><p><p><b>Critical writings and commentary by the Los Angeles based artist Mike Kelley.</b></p><p>The work of artist Mike Kelley (b. 1954) embraces performance, installation, drawing, painting, video, and sculpture. Drawing distinctively on high art and vernacular traditions, including historical research, popular culture, and psychology, Kelley came to prominence in the 1980s with a series of sculptures composed of craft materials. His recent work offers dialogues with architecture and with repressed memory syndrome, and a sustained inquiry into his own aesthetic and social history. The subjects on which Kelley has written are as varied as his artistic media. They include the work of fellow artists, sound, caricature, the uncanny, UFOlogy, and gender-bending.</p><p>This book offers a diverse collection of Kelley's writings from the last twenty-five years. It contains major critical texts on art, film, and the wider culture, including his piece on the aesthetic he calls "urban Gothic." It also contains essays, mostly commissioned for exhibition catalogs and journals, on the artists and groups David Askevold, �yvind Fahlstr�m, Douglas Huebler, John Miller, Survival Research Laboratories, and Paul Thek, among others. Kelley's voices are passionate, analytic, and ironic, and his critical intelligence is leavened with touches of whimsy.</p></p><p>Mike Kelley is a Los Angeles-based artist, noise musician, and writer. He is a member of the graduate faculty in the M.F.A. program at Art Center College of Design, Pasadena.The 17 essays of this collection may prove the most significant set of artist&#x2019;s writings since Robert Smithson&#x2019;s posthumous Collected Writings appeared in 1996. Kelley, a Los Angeles-based artist, is best known for his ironic, politically acidic, often hilarious reconfigurations of cultural tropes, particularly as they have filtered through art and commerce (as when Kelley added breasts to the Native American icon of Land O&#x2019; Lakes butter). From the brilliant juxtaposition of a still from On the Waterfront with one from Blade Runner to a trenchant discussion of Douglas Huebler&#x2019;s riff on Edward Hicks&#x2019;s early 19th-century painting The Peaceable Kingdom, Kelley is rarely short of inspiring in his willingness to follow the consequences of artistic choices, formal and otherwise, into unexpected places. For example, in his essay "Death and Transfiguration," Kelley declares that Paul Thek&#x2019;s "amazing wax effigy of himself: a striking hippie in permanent fixed decay" is "a pink raspberry shitsicle" made in response to the "porcelain-white vanilla bar" of Walt Disney&#x2019;s own frozen corpse. A theory of the Uncanny; commentary on everyone from Marcel Broodthaers and �yvind Fahlstr�m to Baby Huey and the New York Dolls; an analysis of the use of Pepto-Bismol in the work of Korean-American artist Cody Hyun Choi; a comparison between what he sees as the art world&#x2019;s control of art history and the Reagan/Bush capture of the corporate media&#x2014;with 34 black-and-white illustrations to help support these and other arguments, this collection makes a strong case that the best art is "not interested in what&#x2019;s not us." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A new paradigm is needed where we understand the mind and body as an interconnected flowing system. This paradigm embraces the self-healing, self-correcting, and self-creating natures of our connected mind-body system.</p><p>Physical symptoms are simply a sign of disharmony and energetic imbalance, a &#x201c;tap on the shoulder&#x201d; from our intelligent body that is trying to get our attention. This &#x201c;tap&#x201d; on the shoulder can become debilitating symptoms over time. When we pay attention, and understand this communication, we can take the steps to facilitate our own self-healing.</p><p>This book explains the origins of chronic symptoms and outlines the road to recovery. Readers are offered life-changing principles and practices to regain harmony in their lives and bodies, whether they suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, adrenal fatigue, trauma, depression, or anxiety. It explains how we can learn to heal ourselves from the inside out by reconceptualizing the relationships among our bodies, minds, and emotions, embracing the full importance of the mind-body connection, and tapping our natural restorative capacities.</p><p>Here, readers will find ways to maximize the connections between optimum health, peace of mind, and fulfilling life experiences, all emerging when we are aligned with our &#x201c;true self.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Kyle Davies is a chartered psychologist, therapist, coach, and consultant who lives in Cardiff, Wales.&#x201c;This can-do guide offers good advice and insights that can help everyone, not only those with chronic fatigue and pain, be 'active players' who bring passion and purpose to their own 'game of life.' . . . Davies presents empowering ways for people to focus on what they can change and, in the process, to keep their personal 'stress buckets' from overflowing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;If you are looking for a readable introduction to some principles and coaching tools of mind-body medicine to empower your patients, this book is a great start.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>British Journal of General Practice</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Chronic symptoms almost always have some roots that remain undiscovered despite conventional medical intervention. Wouldn't it be nice to know to what degree your symptoms are tied to these roots?

Bornstein, DO, author of <em>Stressed In</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Intelligent Body</em>&nbsp;shines new light on the nature of emotions and their intimate relationship with health and well-being. Kyle Davies gives a convincing assessment of the relationship between our health and our emotions. For anyone with conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, anxiety, and depression, this book is essential reading. It will help you pave the way to recovery, and entertain a fresh perspective on causes as well as solutions.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Francis Teeney, PhD, CPsychol, author of <em>Religion, Civil Society, &amp; Peace in Northern Ireland</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Kyle Davies's 'Energy-flow' approach makes an invaluable contribution to the growing critique of the current biomedical paradigm, with a wealth of practical suggestions to help us maximize our potential as human beings (which Davies rightly places at &nbsp;the heart of our sense of well-being). Davies draws freely from his own life experience (and those of his clients) to illustrate how to apply these ideas in everyday life, helping to make this book both deeply insightful and very readable. Thoroughly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Martin Treacy, PhD, CPsychol, Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book presents a theory suggesting that alignment with the 'true self' is the key to health and well-being. Misalignment causes health problems and 'Energy-flow' is the key to recovery. A series of exercises to help achieve realignment with the true self and a state of high consciousness is presented in the second part of the book. Readers will benefit from repeatedly dipping into the book and will move from an intellectual understanding to a deep body appreciation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andy Smith, PhD, School of Psychology, Cardiff University</strong></p><h2>Alan Turing (Volume 38) (Little People, BIG DREAMS, 38)</h2><p><b>In this book from the critically acclaimed Little People, BIG DREAMS series, discover the&nbsp;life of Alan Turing, the genius code cracker and&nbsp;father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</b><br><br> Alan grew up in England, where his best friends were numbers and a little boy called Christopher.

In the succeeding years, Clemens biographers have either tailored their narratives to fit the parameters of a single volume or focused on a particular period or aspect of Clemens&#x2019;s life, because the whole of that epic life cannot be compressed into a single volume. In <i>The Life of Mark Twain</i>, Gary Scharnhorst has chosen to write a complete biography plotted from beginning to end, from a single point of view, on an expansive canvas.<br> &nbsp;<br> With dozens of Mark Twain biographies available, what is left unsaid? On average, a hundred Clemens letters and a couple of Clemens interviews surface every year. Scharnhorst has located documents relevant to Clemens&#x2019;s life in Missouri, along the Mississippi River, and in the West, including some which have been presumed lost. Over three volumes, Scharnhorst elucidates the life of arguably the greatest American writer and reveals the alchemy of his gifted imagination.</p><p><b>Gary Scharnhorst</b> is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English at the University of New Mexico.

Gary Scharnhorst has taken up this prodigious task, and as a veteran Mark Twain scholar still at the top of his game, he's certainly right for the challenge. Clear and engaging, Scharnhorst&#x2019;s prose keeps you rolling happily through this consummate American adventure.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Bruce Michelson</b>, author of <i>Printer&#x2019;s Devil: Mark Twain and the American Publishing Revolution</i><br><br>"In the near endless attempts to chart the life and times of Mark Twain, most biographers have mapped only parts of Twain's life, focusing solely upon a period, a place, or a set of relationships. In <i>The Life of Mark Twain: The Early Years, 1835-1871</i>, Gary Scharnhorst has widened his lens to take in the sweep of events, the currents of change and creativity in these early years that would make Twain into not just a cultural phenomenon but into the most American of artists. In its wit and clarity, Scharnhorst's biography will appeal to devoted readers of Mark Twain's life and fiction; while scholars will find in this volume a smart, insightful, unsentimental view of Twain&#x2014;no idolizing of St. Mark, or armchair analysis of the Twain/Clemens divide.

Over half the documents made available here were discovered by the editors, including a significant group of over fifty letters that Einstein exchanged with Mileva Maric, his fellow student and future wife. These letters, together with other previously unpublished documents, provide an entirely new view of Einstein's youth. The documents in the volume also foreshadow the emergence of his extraordinary creative power. In them is manifested his intense commitment to scientific work and his interest in certain themes that proved to be central to his thinking during the next decade. We can follow, for example, the beginnings of his preoccupation with the electrodynamics of moving bodies that was to lead to the development of this special theory of relativity. For the first time it can be seen how closely he followed such contemporary developments in physics as Planck's work on radiation theory and Drude's work on the electron theory of metals. In addition to all of Einstein's known correspondence and other writings from this period, the volume includes the relevant portions of all third-party letters and other contemporary documents that provide additional information about his secondary schooling at the Aargau Cantonal School; his four years at the Swiss Federal Plytechnical School, or the ETH; and his search for a job after graduation. Included in the volume are those sections of an unpublished biography by Einstein's sister, Maja Winteler-Einstein, which deal with his early years; his extensive notes on a physics course he took at the ETH; and previously unpublished photographs of the young Einstein and his teachers and friends.</p><br><p> Documents in Volume 1 portray Einstein's experiences during the two stressful years after his graduation from the ETH in Zurich. Denied a position as an Assistant at the ETH, he lived a hand-to-mouth existence while he looked for a post at other universities; then he attempted to find a secondary-school post, and finally sought a nonacademic job. Tension with his parents over his plans to marry Mileva Maric is evident throughout this period. With the help of a friend, he finally found work at the Swiss Patent Office, the haven where he would spend the next seven years. Freed from his financial worries, he entered on one of the most productive periods of his life, as the next volume, Writings (1901-1910), will document.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanThe volume is attractive, the editing perceptive and informative without being intrusive; the translation, an entirely appropriate and insightful compromise between the literary and the literal.

In this remarkable book Jean Baurdrillard&#x2015;France's leading theorist of postmodernity&#x2015;argues that the notion of the end is part of the fantasy of a linear history. Today we are not approaching the end of history but moving into reverse, into a process of systematic obliteration. We are wiping out the entire twentieth century, effacing all signs of the cold War one by one, perhaps even the signs of the First and Second World Wars and of the political and ideological revolutions of our time. In short, we are engaged in a gigantic process of historical revisionism, and we seem in a hurry to finish it before the end of the century, secretly hoping perhaps to be able to begin again from scratch. Baudrillard explores the "fatal strategies of time" which shape our ways of thinking about history and its imaginary end. Ranging from the revolutions in Eastern Europe to the Gulf War, from the transformation of nature to the hyper-reality of the media, this postmodern mediation on modernity and its aftermath will be widely read.</p><p>&#x201c;Vintage Baudrillard&#x2014;compelling, diabolically clever, outrageous, wounded, ironic, refreshing, and certainly controversial.

Imagine being one of the 33% of students who struggle with writing letters and numbers. This inability or difficulty is called dysgraphia. Children who suffer from dysgraphia often earn the reputation of being lazy or dumb. However, these children, like all children, want to succeed. They do not need to live lives of frustration and anxiety and a constant feeling of failing the adults they respect. For over a decade, Cheri Dotterer has observed children with these challenges in school systems across the world. She witnessed their struggle with not only writing, but also the challenging behaviors due to their feelings of defeat from the frustration. While experiencing writing challenges as a child and becoming a professional in occupational therapy with a specialty in dysgraphia, Cheri discovered a powerful process that reduces anxiety and frustration and builds confidence and competence. In this book, you will discover:�How the brain and body work together to create neural pathways for learning�How different environmental features interfere with learning�How to incorporate movement strategies into teaching both spelling and vocabulary in the regular education classroom�How to discuss goals, accommodations, and modifications for special education Individualized Education Programs (IEP) or 504 plans.Eliminate stress today by including these adaptive techniques into your classroom and home today!</p><p>With over 20 years of occupational therapy experience, author and mentor Cheri Dotterer is zealous about the how we learn. Pediatrics has always been her passion and love. Her favorite part of practice is seeing the &#34;light bulb&#34; go on in the mind of parents, teachers, and children. Cheri has made it her mission to help parents and teachers inspire children to transform the children&#39;s perspective on learning through easy-to-implement techniques teachers and parents can use to improve motivation in the classroom and at home. Cheri brings with her years of research and education. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in both Biochemistry and Occupational Therapy and later a Master of Science in Occupational Therapy. In addition, she holds a certificate as a Board-Certified Educational Advocate and Neuroscience Coach. Furthermore, she has worked alongside several universities creating unique experiences for OT students and organizations in the practice of occupational therapy through adjunct faculty and guest lecturer positions. Cheri sees the world from a non-traditional perspective. She has a private practice in Pennsylvania and lives with her husband of 27 years, their two children, and their cat, Snowball. Discovering a method of using motion to improve spelling and vocabulary, Cheri is now a Dysgraphia Consultant and author.<p>FOREWORD</p><p>"In her famous TED talk, the late Rita Pierson said, "Every<br> child deserves a champion; an adult who will never<br> give up on them, who understands the power of connection<br> and insists that they become the best they can<br> possibly be."

Protesting capitalism, American imperialism, and Gaullism, 9 million people from all walks of life, from shipbuilders to department store clerks, stopped working. The nation was paralyzed&#x2014;no sector of the workplace was untouched. Yet, just thirty years later, the mainstream image of May '68 in France has become that of a mellow youth revolt, a cultural transformation stripped of its violence and profound sociopolitical implications.<br> <br> Kristin Ross shows how the current official memory of May '68 came to serve a political agenda antithetical to the movement's aspirations. She examines the roles played by sociologists, repentant ex-student leaders, and the mainstream media in giving what was a political event a predominantly cultural and ethical meaning. Recovering the political language of May '68 through the tracts, pamphlets, and documentary film footage of the era, Ross reveals how the original movement, concerned above all with the question of equality, gained a new and counterfeit history, one that erased police violence and the deaths of participants, removed workers from the picture, and eliminated all traces of anti-Americanism, anti-imperialism, and the influences of Algeria and Vietnam. <i>May '68 and Its Afterlives</i> is especially timely given the rise of a new mass political movement opposing global capitalism, from labor strikes and anti-McDonald's protests in France to the demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle.</p></p><p><b>Kristin Ross</b> is professor of comparative literature at New York University. She is the author of <i>The Emergence of Social Space: Rimbaud and the Paris Commune and Fast Cars, Clean Bodies: Decolonization and the Reordering of French Culture.</i>&#34;May &#39;68 and Its Afterlives dismantles every cliche we have about the uprisings in Paris. But in a deeper sense, it is about what has been made of May. Kristin Ross is, to my knowledge, the first person working either here or in France to take on the complexity of thirty years of ideological discourse about May &#39;68. We can&#39;t underestimate the importance of this book, not just for studying France, but for understanding political experience anywhere in the world.&#34; - Alice Kaplan, author of The Collaborator: The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach</p><h2>October 31, 1517: Martin Luther and the Day that Changed the World</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This volume is small but weighty and a solid addition for all modern Christianity collections.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Ray Olson, </b><i>Booklist</i><br><br> With a foreword by James Martin, this classic reader on the Reformation by Martin Marty answers the question:&nbsp;Why is the Reformation relevant today?<br><br> Most importantly, this book is about how the Reformation impacts us devotionally as Christians of any denomination.<br><br> Accessible for church groups or personal reading, this is not a&nbsp;historical narrative of Reformation events, but an explanation of the issues that led to Luther&#x2019;s posting of the 95 Theses and their implications for the Church and the world.<br><br> As one of the world&#x2019;s preeminent Luther scholars, Martin Marty also explores the concept of repentance as a central theme of the Theses.

Torn between his devotion to Gwendolen and his passion for Mirah and the plight of her people, Daniel is forced to look at his own mysterious past and find out who he really is&#x2015;and who he wants to become.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;REarl L.

He received his Ph.D. in English from the University of Maryland. He reviews books regularly for the <i>Houston Chronicle</i>.<br><b>From Earl Dachslager&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Daniel Deronda</i></b> <p>In itself, <i>Daniel Deronda</i>&#x2019;s position as Eliot&#x2019;s last novel lends it some significance, but, far more important, <i>Daniel Deronda</i> represents Eliot&#x2019;s summing up, the book in which she hoped to bring together all the values, ideals, and beliefs that had informed her earlier work. In short, <i>Daniel Deronda</i> was not simply Eliot&#x2019;s final novel, it was her final letter to the world. That she herself was aware that <i>Daniel Deronda</i> was her fictional finale is made clear from her notes and letters. She recorded in her diary for December 31, 1877 (her final entry): &#x201c;But of course as the years advance there is a new rational ground for the expectation that my life may become less fruitful. . . . Many conceptions of works to be carried out present themselves, but confidence in my own fitness to complete them worthily is all the more wanting because it is reasonable to argue that I must have already done my best&#x201d; (Haight, ed. <i>Selections from George Eliot&#x2019;s Letters</i>, pp. 493&#x2013;494 [henceforth, <i>Letters</i>]; see &#x201c;For Further Reading&#x201d;). </p><p>From the beginning, Eliot&#x2019;s books cost her an enormous outlay of energy&#x2014;physical and emotional. Each book brought with it anxiety and the desperate feeling that not only would the book never be completed but also that in the end it would be worthless. She had arrived at the conviction that authors should stop when they had no more to say. But even if she had the energy and desire to write another &#x201c;big book,&#x201d; they likely vanished when Lewes died, at age sixty-one, on November 30, 1878; he had been her partner and champion for nearly twenty-five years and, to some degree, her creator. &#x201c;Without George Henry Lewes,&#x201d; Kathryn Hughes wrote, in her excellent biography of Eliot, &#x201c;there could have been no George Eliot&#x201d; (<i>George Eliot: The Last Victorian</i>, p. 327). </p><p><i>Daniel Deronda</i> thus stands as the culmination of a series of novels that began twenty years earlier with the publication of <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i> (1858). But in some original and singular respects, <i>Daniel Deronda</i> may also be viewed as Eliot&#x2019;s <i>first</i> fictional creation. </p><p>For one thing, of all of Eliot&#x2019;s novels<i> Daniel Deronda</i> is by far the most global, the one with the widest range of national and international references. Geographically, <i>Daniel Deronda</i> takes the reader to London, Paris, Prague, Vienna, Rome, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Mainz, Genoa, Trieste, Beirut (or &#x201c;Beyrout&#x201d; as Eliot spells it), Sardinia, Corsica, Ajaccio, Palestine, and New York&#x2014;a globe-hopping journey that in itself makes<i> Daniel Deronda</i> unique among Eliot&#x2019;s novels. For that reason, it has often been called the first international novel. Writing in the <i>Nation</i> the year <i>Daniel Deronda</i> was published, Henry James praised the novel for its &#x201c;multitudinous world&#x201d; and &#x201c;its widening narrative&#x201d; (quoted in Haight, <i>A Century of George Eliot Criticism</i>, pp. 92&#x2013;93). </p><p>Also unique is that <i>Daniel Deronda</i> is the only novel Eliot wrote that is set close to her own time. The action of the novel takes place over two years, between October 1864 and October 1866, and begins in September 1865 (see note 1). Thus the events of the story take place approximately ten years before the book was published, which makes it Eliot&#x2019;s most contemporary novel and the one that is most connected to topics current in her day. </p><p><i>Daniel Deronda</i> is also Eliot&#x2019;s most original novel in its construction (anticipated, to some degree, by her 1859 gothic story &#x201c;The Lifted Veil&#x201d;), one of the earliest examples in English prose fiction of what would become the hallmark of much modern literature: the replacement of the straightforward, linear plot&#x2014;beginning, middle, end&#x2014;with a disrupted, nonlinear plot that depends on both flashbacks and flash-forwards. </p><p>The effect of the narrative&#x2019;s temporal and spatial shifts is to give the story the illusion of movement in time and space and to make the main characters appear as a Victorian version of jet-setters. Unlike Eliot&#x2019;s provincial novels&#x2014;<i>Adam Bede</i> (1859), <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> (1860), and <i>Silas Marner</i> (1861)&#x2014;<i>Daniel Deronda</i> is not a book about rural England or even fifteenth-century Florence, the setting of Eliot&#x2019;s 1863 novel <i>Romola</i>, but about Europe, the Middle East, and even America, where Mirah Lapidoth has been. To this extent, <i>Daniel Deronda</i> is Eliot&#x2019;s most expansive novel and one of the most far-ranging in nineteenth-century literature. </p><p>But even more radical than its bold use of time and space&#x2014;certainly more daring for its day&#x2014;is the novel&#x2019;s movement across social, political, psychological, and literary boundaries. Such transitions and transformations result from what the novel is about: the conflicts and connections, differences and similarities, between two separate but related worlds&#x2014;the &#x201c;Jewish&#x201d; world and the &#x201c;English&#x201d; world, the first represented primarily by Daniel Deronda and Mordecai Lapidoth; the second by Gwendolen Harleth, her mother, and their social community.</p></p><h2>The Uses of Argument</h2><p>Traditionally, logic has been claimed to be &#39;the science of rational argument&#39;, but the relevance to our everyday disputes of the formal logician&#39;s results has remained unclear. The abstract character of traditional logic cuts the subject off from practical considerations; Mr Toulmin enquires why this is so, and shows how an alternative conception can be of more general value. Starting from an examination of the actual procedures in different fields of argument - the practice, as opposed to the theory, of logic - he discloses a richer variety than is allowed for by any available system. He argues that jurisprudence rather than mathematics should be the logician&#39;s model in analysing rational procedures, and that logic should be a comparative and not a purely formal study. These suggestions lead to conclusions which many will consider controversial; though they will also be widely recognized as interesting and illuminating. This book extends into general philosophy lines of enquiry already sketched by Mr Toulmin in his earlier books on ethics and the philosophy of science. The ordinary reader will find in it the same clarity and intelligibility; and the professional philosopher will acknowledge the same power to break new ground (and circumvent old difficulties) by posing fresh and stimulating questions.</p><p>&#34;In spite of initial criticisms from logicians and fellow philosophers, The Uses of Argument has been an enduring source of inspiration and discussion to students of argumentation from all kinds of disciplinary background for more than forty years. &#34; Frans van Eemeren, University of AmsterdamStephen E.

Poet, dramatist, critic, scientist, administrator and novelist, he was born at Frankfurt-am-Main in 1749, the son of well-to-do parents with intellectual interests; and he studied at the University of Leipzig and at Strassburg, where he wrote a play which initiated the important Sturm und Drang movement. During the next five years he practiced law in Frankfurt and wrote The Sorrows of Young Werther, a remarkable novel autobiographical of one side of Goethe&#39;s nature. In 1775 he went to visit the court of the young Duke of Weimar, and, except for an extended journey to Italy a decade later, stayed there the rest of his life, filling at one time or another all the major posts in the Weimar government. Here a close friendship with Schiller developed, and here he conducted important scientific experiments and published a steady stream of books of the highest order and in many different forms. He became the director of the Weimar Theatre in 1791 and made it the most famous in Europe. His life held a number of ardent loves, which he celebrated in lyrics that are compared to Shakespeare&#39;s, and in 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius whom he had loved for many years. In later life Goethe became a generous patron of younger writers, including Byron and Carlyle. In 1790 he published the first version of his life work as Faust, a Fragment, but Part I of the completed Faust did not appear until 1808, while Part II was finished and published only a few months before Goethe&#39;s death in 1832.</p><h2>How Steam Locomotives Really Work (Popular Science)</h2><p>Steam locomotives were developed in the early part of the 19th Century, initially by Trevithick, and then most successfully by George Stephenson, whose engine <em>Locomotion</em> inaugurated the famous Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. For the next 150 years, steam locomotives were further developed and refined, until the advent of new electrical technology superseded them. Although British Railways operated its last main-line steam locomotives in 1968, there is still immense interest in the large numbers of locomotives that have been privately preserved, and which run on heritage railways and in various parts of the world. This book describes the anatomy and physiology of the steam train, to enable all train enthusiasts to understand the workings of the various types of engines in use. It covers the design of the engine, the process of converting fuel into mechanical tractive effort to haul passenger and freight trains, and the function and design of the various components of the engine. The authors also outline the reasons behind the safe and efficient operation and maintenance of steam locomotives. Although the steam locomotive originated in the UK, there were parallel lines of development in North America and in various other European countries, many of which introduced their own individual features. These are dealt with in the book, which will appeal to railway enthusiasts throughout the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Semmens</strong> was formerly Deputy Head of the highly popular National Railway Museum in York from 1974, and has been active for many years in the popularization of science and technology.

The protests against the marketing of indulgences staged by the German monk Martin Luther in 1517 belonged to a long-standing pattern of calls for internal reform and renewal in the Christian Church. But they rapidly took a radical and unexpected turn, engulfing first Germany and then Europe as a whole in furious arguments about how God's will was to be "saved".<br><br>However, these debates did not remain confined to a narrow sphere of theology. They came to reshape politics and international relations; social, cultural, and artistic developments; relations between the sexes; and the patterns and performances of everyday life. They were also the stimulus for Christianity's transformation into a truly global religion, as agents of the Roman Catholic Church sought to compensate for losses in Europe with new conversions in Asia and the Americas.<br><br>Covering both Protestant and Catholic reform movements, in Europe and across the wider world, this beautifully illustrated volume tells the story of the Reformation from its immediate, explosive beginnings, through to its profound longer-term consequences and legacy for the modern world. The story is not one of an inevitable triumph of liberty over oppression, enlightenment over ignorance. Rather, it tells how a multitude of rival groups and individuals, with or without the support of political power, strove after visions of "reform". And how, in spite of themselves, they laid the foundations for the plural and conflicted world we now inhabit.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Marshall</strong> was born and raised in the Orkney Islands, and educated at Oxford University.

Emanating from sources both within and close to the Imperial Family as well as from their captors and executioners, these often-controversial materials have enabled a new and comprehensive examination of one the pivotal events of the twentieth century and the many controversies that surround it.<br><br>Based on a careful analysis of more than 500 of these previously unpublished documents, along with numerous newly discovered photos, The Fate of the Romanovs makes compelling revisions to many long-held beliefs about the Romanovs' final months and moments. This powerful account includes:<br>* Surprising evidence that Anastasia may, indeed, have survived<br>* Diary entries made by Nicholas and Alexandra during their captivity<br>* Revelations of how the Romanovs were betrayed by trusted servants<br>* A reconstruction of daily life among the prisoners at Ipatiev House<br>* Strong evidence that the Romanovs were not brutalized by their captors<br>* Statements from admitted participants in the murders</p><p>Rumors, mysteries, and tales of horrifying privation and torture have echoed through the years, inspiring wild speculation and fantastic claims of the "truth" of the final days of Russia&#x2019;s Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Now, in the first comprehensive account of their imprisonment and murder since the family&#x2019;s remains were enshrined in St. Petersburg, The Fate of the Romanovs challenges earlier descriptions of these events with a wealth of fresh evidence and a careful re-examination of established facts.<p>Drawing from more than 500 previously unpublished documents, authors Greg King and Penny Wilson make compelling, controversial revisions to commonly held beliefs. They reveal that the family was not treated in a barbaric fashion during their captivity, but rather with a great deal of civility. They also dispel the legend that the family members remained devoted to each other throughout their ordeal; months of uncertainty and anxiety led to a slow but inexorable disintegration of family bonds.</p><p>This vividly narrated expos� delves deeply into the long-secret archives of the Russian Revolution to discover that Lenin did not order the family&#x2019;s execution&#x2013;as had been previously thought&#x2013;and to reveal who actually made the decision and how it was carried out. Secret documents also disclose that the KGB orchestrated the 1978 "discovery" of the Romanov grave and that the Soviet government had known of its existence from the beginning.</p><p>Most shocking of all is the confirmation that two of the tsar&#x2019;s children may have escaped execution and that the fabled Grand Duchess Anastasia could well have been one of them. Shocking in another way is the revelation of successful efforts of Imperial hangers-on to barter for their own freedom using the Romanovs&#x2019; vast cache of jewels.</p><p>Every claim and assertion in this startling new report is supported with copious documentary evidence from multiple sources. The authors cite many accounts from those closest to the actual events, including memoirs by the commandant of the Ipatiev House in which the family was imprisoned; Victor Netrebin, who participated in the murders; Bolshevik officials who revealed the betrayal of the Romanovs by their servants; and a physician who was given access to the Imperial prisoners. They also quote the statements of guards Alexei Kabanov and Alexander Strekotin and draw information from Romanov family papers, including personal letters and documents on the fate of the Romanov remains.</p><p>Supplemented with numerous, never-before-published photos and a helpful cast of characters numbering in the hundreds, The Fate of the Romanovs explodes myths, confirms long-dismissed theories, solves mysteries, and poses intriguing new questions about events that, though they occurred nearly a century ago, continue to fascinate the world.</p>GREG KING is the author of five previous books.

While vacationing in Venice, this highly disciplined writer, who always has maintained extraordinary control of his literary creations, finds himself suddenly overwhelmed by an all-consuming love for a beautiful young boy. A deadly epidemic sweeps through the city, but Aschenbach's attraction to the youth compels him to remain, thus sealing his fate.<br>The second work in this volume, "A Man and His Dog," concerns Bauschan, a friendly mongrel pointer acquired by the Mann family in 1916. A constant companion during the author's morning walks, the loyal creature also deposited himself regularly under Mann's desk while the author worked &#x2014; a gesture not always appreciated by the writer. More of a genial essay or memoir than a "story," this charming piece, including "one of the most beautiful descriptions of landscape in German literature," is reprinted here with its original preface, which is translated (most likely for the first time) into English.<br>For both works, Stanley Appelbaum has provided an introduction and informative notes, along with excellent new English translations on the pages facing the original German.<br><br></p><p>Stanley Appelbaum served for decades as Dover&#39;s Editor in Chief until his retirement in 1996.

It emphasizes Lang&#39;s reflection on modernity, and hones in on the problem of identity and subjectivity in a progressively more automated, impersonal world.</p><p>In this remarkable new study, the renowned historian and theorist of early cinema turns his attention to the work of Fritz Lang, proposing new readings of the entire output of one of cinema&#39;s foremost directors. Gunning examines the films not only as a stylistically coherent body of work, but as an attempt to portray the modern world through cinema. The world of modernity in which systems replace individuals is conveyed by Lange&#39;s mastery of cinematic set design, composition, and editing. Lang presents not only a decades-long vision of cinematic narrative that can be compared to that of Alfred Hitchcock or Jean Renoir, but a view of modernity that relates strongly to the ideas of Adorno, Brecht, Benjamin, and Kracauer. From the sweeping allegorical films of the &#39;20s to the chilly and abstract thrillers of the &#39;50s, Fritz Lang&#39;s films, Gunning claims, are among the most precious records of the twentieth century. &#34;The Films of Fritz Lang&#34; immeasurably enriches our understanding of a great artist who fades away even in being recognized and interpreted, an enigmatic figure at the junction of aesthetics, history, biography and theory.Tom Gunning is Professor of Art History, Cinema and Media Studies at the University of Chicago.

In order to find this book useful, readers must already own the LEGO EV3 Mindstorms kit; author Benedettelli provides a chart of pieces in the appendix that readers should acquire if they own different versions of Mindstorms kits. Tech-savvy students will find the projects engrossing, but be forewarned that this text is not for novice Mindstorms users or those new to robotics. Black-and-white drawings may prove challenging for some to compare with real life colored LEGOs. Readers are treated to a comic narrative throughout the book that mimics the book's progress, which can help break up the tedious nature of instructional text and drawings, though they are more entertaining than informative. Benedettelli painstakingly describes how to manipulate the kits and their myriad parts and does not assume that the reader will have access to a computer, helpfully describing how to program without one. A good addition for schools serving students on robotics or LEGO teams, but this guide may not find wide readership in most public libraries.&#x2014;Amy M.

Indeed, one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most revered icons was a lively, prolific correspondent who developed in rich, nuanced dispatches the ideas that would influence generations of writers and intellectuals. This historic work&#x2015;never before published in America and featuring many previously unseen letters&#x2015;presents an account of Orwell&#x2019;s interior life as personal and absorbing as readers may ever see. <p>Over the course of a lifetime, Orwell corresponded with hundreds of people, including many distinguished political and artistic figures. Witty, personal, and profound, the letters tell the story of Orwell&#x2019;s passionate first love that ended in devastation and explains how young Eric Arthur Blair chose the pseudonym "George Orwell." In missives to luminaries such as T. S. Eliot, Stephen Spender, Arthur Koestler, Cyril Connolly, and Henry Miller, he spells out his literary and philosophical beliefs. Readers will encounter Orwell&#x2019;s thoughts on matters both quotidian (poltergeists and the art of playing croquet) and historical&#x2015;including his illuminating descriptions of war-shattered Barcelona and pronouncements on bayonets and the immanent cruelty of chaining German prisoners.</p><p>The letters also reveal the origins of his famous novels. To a fan he wrote, "I think, and have thought ever since the war began...that our cause is the better, but we have to keep on making it the better, which involves constant criticism." A paragraph before, he explained that the British intelligentsia in 1944 were "perfectly ready for dictatorial methods, secret police, systematic falsification of history," prefiguring the themes of <em>1984</em>. Entrusting the manuscript of <em>Animal Farm</em> to Leonard Moore, his literary agent, Orwell describes it as "a sort of fairy story, really a fable with political meaning...This book is murder from the Communist point of view."</p><p>Hardly known outside a small circle of Orwell scholars, these rare letters include Orwell&#x2019;s message to Dwight Macdonald of 5 December 1946 explaining <em>Animal Farm</em>; his correspondence with his first translator, R. N. Raimbault (with English translations of the French originals); and the moving encomium written about Orwell by his BBC head of department after his service there. The volume concludes with a fearless account of the painful illness that took Orwell&#x2019;s life at age forty-seven. His last letter concerns his son and his estate and closes with the words, "Beyond that I can&#x2019;t make plans at present."</p><p>Meticulously edited and fully annotated by Peter Davison, the world&#x2019;s preeminent Orwell scholar, the volume presents Orwell &#x201c;in all his varieties&#x201d; and his relationships with those most close to him, especially his first wife, Eileen. Combined with rare photographs and hand-drawn illustrations, <em>George Orwell: A Life in Letters</em> offers "everything a reader new to Orwell needs to know...and a great deal that diehard fans will be enchanted to have" (<em>New Statesmen</em>).</p> 28 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>George Orwell</strong> (Eric Arthur Blair, 1903&#x2013;1950) wrote fiction, journalism, criticism, and poetry.

If Davison&#x2019;s compilation of Orwell&#x2019;s letters, which help fill out our understanding of this oft-caricatured writer, can draw readers more deeply into the life and catalogue of George Orwell, then he will have accomplished an important objective.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Lang, <em>America: The National Catholic Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In distilling the 1,700 letters written by Orwell, Davison set himself two goals: the letters should illustrate his life and hopes, and &#x201c;each should be of interest in its own right.&#x201d; This volume admirably fulfills this twofold mission; it is a tribute to Davison&#x2019;s decades-long scholarship on Orwell&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Daniel P.

In this book a master scientist tells the great story of how life on earth evolved. E.O. Wilson eloquently describes how the species of the world became diverse, and why the threat to this diversity today is beyond the scope of anything we have known before. In an extensive new foreword for this edition, Professor Wilson addresses the explosion of the field of conservation biology and takes a clear-eyed look at the work still to be done.</p><p>Humans, the Harvard University entomologist Edward O. Wilson has observed, have an innate--or at least extremely ancient--connection to the natural world, and our continued divorce from it has led to the loss of not only "a vast intellectual legacy born of intimacy" with nature, but also our very sanity. In <i>The Diversity of Life</i>, Wilson takes a sweeping view of our planet's natural richness, remarking on what on the surface seems a paradox: "almost all the species that ever lived are extinct, and yet more are alive today than at any time in the past." (Wilson's elegant explanation is a scientific education in itself.) This great variety of species is, of course, threatened by habitat destruction, global climate change, and a host of other forces, and Wilson revisits his oft-stated call for the protection of wilderness and undeveloped land, noting that "wilderness has virtue unto itself and needs no extraneous justification." We should, he continues, regard every species, "every scrap of biodiversity," as precious and irreplaceable, without attempting to quantify that regard with utilitarian measures such as "bio-economics." In short, Wilson offers with this book a simple, workable environmental ethic that extends the work of Aldo Leopold and other conservationists. A remarkably productive and influential scientist, Wilson is also a fine writer, and his survey of biodiversity makes for welcome and instructive reading. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Edward O. Wilson is widely recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s preeminent biologists and naturalists. The author of more than thirty books, including The Social Conquest of Earth, The Meaning of Human Existence, and Letters to a Young Scientist, Wilson is a professor emeritus at Harvard University. The winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, he lives with his wife, Irene Wilson, in Lexington, Massachusetts.</p><h2>In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process 1: The Colonial Period</h2><p>Focusing on the actions and attitudes of the courts, legislatures, and public servants in six colonies, Judge Higginbotham shows ways in which the law has contributed to injustices suffered by Black Americans</p><p>In this midst of heated, often poisonous, arguments about affirmative action, school busing, and race-based political redistricting, A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. provides a welcome voice of reason. The sequel to his acclaimed <i>In the Matter of Color</i>, published in 1978, <i>Shades of Freedom</i> is a history of American racial law from the 17th century to the present. This long and often dark chronology is examined with precision, providing Higginbotham ample space to air his own view, that America has come far but still has far to go. Higginbotham, the former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court Appeals for the Third Circuit and the winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, is unabashedly liberal, especially in wholeheartedly supporting the concept of political districts designed to create black majorities. His analyses, particularly of major decisions such as the 1857 Dred Scott case, are compelling and elegant. And his indignation is palpable.In his first book, Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., one of the first five African Americans to become a federal judge, shows how the law itself contributed to inflicting injustice on millions of Americans, solely on the basis of their color. For many readers - even those well-steeped in African-American studies or American history or the law - this book will stir new passions.</p><h2>The Crock-Pot Ladies Big Book of Slow Cooker Dinners: More Than 300 Fabulous and Fuss-Free Recipes for Families on the Go</h2><p><b><i>The Crock-Pot Ladies Big Book of Slow Cooker Dinners </i>is a&nbsp;lifetime of delicious dinner ideas that are as easy to make as they are flavorful.</b><br><br> The Crock-Pot Ladies walk the walk of raising busy families and feeding them well.

It also saw the development of a wide range of radical and challenging ideas, from Thales' claim that magnets have souls and Parmenides' account of one unchanging existence to the development of an atomist theory of the physical world. This general account of the Presocratics introduces the major Greek philosophical thinkers from the sixth to the middle of the fifth century B.C. It explores how we might reconstruct their views and understand the motivation and context for their work, and it highlights the ongoing philosophical interest of their often surprising claims. Separate chapters are devoted to each of the major Presocratic thinkers, including Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Leucippus, and Democritus. With a chronology and guide to further reading, this book is an ideal introduction for the student and general reader. <br><br><i>Copub: Acumen Publishing Limited</i></p><p>"An excellent book and a pleasure to read.

His other books include Beyond Wall Street (Wiley, 1998) and Five Eminent Contrarians.</p><p>In the investment-management business, it's best to take bows quickly. Unless, of course, you're John Neff, a living legend, who as manager of Vanguard's Windsor Fund beat the market in 22 out of 31 years. Neff grew Windsor to become the largest mutual fund by combing the bargain basement for quality merchandise and selling as other investors caught on. In <i>John Neff on Investing</i>, he explains how he scoured the daily list of stocks hitting new lows, the "dusty rag and bone shop of the market," to find out-of-favor companies with low price/earnings ratios, those growing faster than seven percent a year, that paid generous dividends. He shows how to distinguish misunderstood and overlooked stocks from those with lackluster prospects.<p> Shunning the terms <i>value investor</i> and <i>contrarian</i>, he tells us he prefers to be known simply as a "low-p/e investor." "Contrarian investor suggests a stubborn nature," he says, "and there's a thin line between contrarian and being just plain stubborn." Memory in the stock market is notoriously short. "Remember the lessons of the past as they tend to repeat themselves," Neff says. "You cannot become a captive of historical parallel, but you must be a student of history." He takes us back to the early '70s, the "silly season" he calls it, "when investors emphasized a handful of glamour stocks at the expense of the market.... Hypnotized by rising market levels, investors lost sight of fundamentals ... and a dazed and confused public became persuaded that investing is easy." The toughest investment decision is the decision to sell. "Successful stocks don't tell you when to sell," says Neff. "When you feel like bragging, it's probably time to sell." He quotes a French proverb: "Buy on the cannons, sell on the trumpets."</p><p> <i>John Neff on Investing</i> begins with an insightful autobiographical sketch, but the marrow of this book is the journey through Neff's investment diary while managing Windsor. He takes us through three turbulent decades and dissects in detail his investment successes and failures. Relying on relentless application of his low-p/e strategy, abetted by attention to fundamentals and a liberal dose of common sense, he repeatedly rode stocks from under- to fair valuation, most often leaving the overvaluation thrill ride to braver souls.</p><p> Neff explains his concept of Measured Participation, a sort of asset-allocation strategy for low-p/e investing, and he shows that while difficult in today's high valuation market, constructing a portfolio guided by his methodology is still possible. Anyone with an interest in investing will enjoy learning at the feet of this master. <i>--Scott Harrison</i></p>John Neff has proven time and again over the past three decades that bucking the system can pay off big.

Likewise, the economic theory of the firm, building on Ronald Coase&#39;s (1937) seminal analysis, has become an increasingly important field in economics and management. Despite this resurgence, there is still little connection between the entrepreneurship literature and the literature on the firm, both in academia and in management practice. This book fills this gap by proposing and developing an entrepreneurial theory of the firm that focuses on the connections between entrepreneurship and management. Drawing on insights from Austrian economics, it describes entrepreneurship as judgmental decision made under uncertainty, showing how judgment is the driving force of the market economy and the key to understanding firm performance and organization.</p><p>Drawing on insights from Austrian economics, this book shows how judgment is the key to understanding firm performance and organization.

In it, she and a dozen or so of her friends from the Chicago suburb of Evanston sit on a porch. It's 1974, the summer after they graduated from Nichols Middle School, and what strikes her immediately&#x2014;aside from the <i>Soul Train</i>&#x2013;era clothes&#x2014;is the diversity of the group: boys and girls, black and white, in the variety of poses you'd expect from a bunch of friends on the verge of high school. But the photo also speaks to the history of Evanston, to integration, and to the ways that those in the picture experienced and remembered growing up in a place that many at that time considered to be a racial utopia.<br> <br> In <i>Friends Disappear</i> Barr goes back to her old neighborhood and pieces together a history of Evanston with a particular emphasis on its neighborhoods, its schools, and its work life. She finds that there is a detrimental myth of integration surrounding Evanston despite bountiful evidence of actual segregation, both in the archives and from the life stories of her subjects. Curiously, the city&#x2019;s own desegregation plan is partly to blame. The initiative called for the redistribution of students from an all-black elementary school to institutions situated in white neighborhoods. That, however, required busing, and between the tensions it generated and obvious markers of class difference, the racial divide, far from being closed, was widened. <i>Friends Disappear</i> highlights how racial divides limited the life chances of blacks while providing opportunities for whites, and offers an insider&#x2019;s perspective on the social practices that doled out benefits and penalties based on race&#x2014;despite attempts to integrate.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Mary Barr </b>is a lecturer at Clemson University.<br>&#x201c;Barr&#x2019;s <i>Friends Disappear </i>is a poignant reminder of how far we have yet to travel when it comes to facing honestly the full complexity of the battles for civil rights and equality. Diving beneath the surface of what appeared to be a childhood filled with examples of racial progress, Barr uncovers a thicket of broken promises and unrealized dreams, the deflections of civic boosterism, and the tragic manifestations of structural inequalities that survived despite the &#x2018;triumph&#x2019; of the civil rights movement. In our putatively post-racial world we urgently need to listen to what Barr is telling us.&#x201d;<br> (Jonathan Holloway <i>Yale University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Barr has written a perceptive, moving, and at times turbulent portrait of Evanston, IL, a town that boasts an image of racial harmony and integration, even as it continues to produce sharp racial disparities in the life chances of its residents. In exploring the fate of her own generation of Evanstonians, Barr reveals the powerful role of race in structuring access to opportunity, wealth, and even to life itself. This story of an interracial group of childhood friends serves as a metaphor for the persistence of inequality in post-civil rights America; but we must also make it a call to action.&#x201d; (Martha Biondi, Northwestern University)<br><br>&#x201c;This bold and beautifully modulated book adds substantively to knowledge of Chicago's suburbs. It takes apart the machinery of systematic inequality with both sensitivity and patience. Barr offers more than a vivid, sociological survey of how racial hierarchy collided with the lived experience of children unaware of how it overdetermined their life chances. All the more shocking for its mildness, <i>Friends Disappear</i> is an innovative work about racism that deserves to be influential and very widely read.&#x201d; (Paul Gilroy <i>King&#x2019;s College London</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Barr's gripping exploration of the divergent paths friends took away from a childhood snapshot combines the rigor of scholarship with the personal touch of memoir. I have rarely read a book that so effectively illustrates the persistence of racial disparities in the United States with unforgettable, wrenching life stories.&#x201d; (Amanda Seligman <i>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating and painful study of one city's struggle with integration, fair housing and equality. . . . Barr's work is a nuanced yet sometimes disturbing look at Evanston's evolution on this important topic.&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[An] excellent example of how to get past the figurative and literal gates of the suburbs in order to explore themes and processes that are central to sociological inquiry&#x2014;inequality, social control, intergenerational reproduction, racial stratification, family relations, delinquency, school sorting, and many more. . . . Barr explodes the myth of racial equality and exposes practices of exclusion and segregation in the experiences of her black and white friends at Evanston Township High School.&#x201d; (Mary Pattillo <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A provocative sociological case study. Grounded in her youth growing up in Evan�ston in the 1960s and 1970s, Barr&#x2019;s narrative of the push for integration and its limits calls into question the &#x2018;hegemonic account&#x2019; of the happily integrated Chicago suburb that is home to Northwestern University. . . . In the most compelling and original passages, Barr draws upon interviews with her friends to highlight individual consequences of per�sistent race and class inequality. . . . The accessibility of Barr&#x2019;s argu�ments may allow her to attract a larger read�ership than many scholarly monographs for this effective brief against na�ve optimism for a postracial society, even in the nation&#x2019;s seem�ingly most enlightened and privileged sub�urbs.&#x201d; (Jeffrey Helgeson <i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Barr should be commended for her attempts to marry abstract theory with tangible personalities and examples. She draws from a range of historical and sociological literature, using Evanston to typify the insights of other scholars. Most of what Barr discusses here will be familiar for most scholars, although distilling it into one case study is valuable and humanizing. . . . As a challenge to a city happily describing itself as integrated while ignoring the ways that it was not, Barr&#x2019;s book is an important and valuable case study.&#x201d; (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A powerful and poignant application of the sociological imagination to the structural history and personal biography of a community&#x2019;s race relations. <i>Friends Disappear</i> can serve as a text as well as a research monograph, and the writing is readily accessible to students. It can serve policymakers as a statement highlighting the subtlety of problems of class and the color line yet to be solved.&#x201d; (<i>Contemporary Sociology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Unlike other works on school desegregation that detail the shape of policy or seek to evaluate its merits in relation to other forms of civil rights reform, in <i>Friends Disappear</i>, Barr provides an intimate look at the lives of the children who experienced it firsthand in Evanston, Illinois. Barr grew up in Evanston and was a student during the initial years of desegregation. She argues in <i>Friends Disappear</i> that the pervasive ways in which race and class shaped the lives of young people limited the extent to which school desegregation could serve as a remedy to the racial wrongs of the American past.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Middle West Review</i>)</p><h2>Being the Body</h2><p><p>Charles Colson has been called, "one of the most important social reformers in a generation." Ten years ago in<i>The Body</i>, Colson turned his prophetic attention to the church and how it might break out of its cultural captivity and reassert its biblical identity.</p><p>Today the book's classic truths have not changed. But the world we live in has. Christians in America have had their complacency shattered and their beliefs challenged. Around the world, the clash of world views has never been more strident. Before all of us, daily, are the realities of life and death, terror and hope, light and darkness, brokeness and healing. We cannot withdraw to the comfort of our santuaries...we must engage. For, if ever there was a time for Christians to be the Body of Christ in the world, it is now.</p><p>In this new, revised and expanded edition of <i>The Body,</i> Charles Colson revisits the question, "What is the church and what is its relevance to contemporary culture at large?" Provocative and insightful,<i>Being the Body</i> inspires us to rise above a stunted "Jesus and me" faith to a nobler view of something bigger and grander than ourselves --the glorious, holy vision for which God created the church.</p></p><p><p>Chuck Colson was a popular and widely known author, speaker, and radio commentator. A former presidential aide to Richard Nixon and founder of the international ministry Prison Fellowship, he wrote several books that have shaped Christian thinking on a variety of subjects, including <em>Born Again</em>, L<em>oving God</em>, <em>How Now Shall We Live?</em>, <em>The Good Life</em>, and <em>The Faith</em>. His radio broadcast, BreakPoint, at one point aired to two million listeners. Chuck Colson donated all of his royalties, awards, and speaking fees to Prison Fellowship Ministries.</p><p>September 11. No matter how much time goes by or what has happened since, it still seems unbelievable. A dividing line in all our lives. Before and after.</p><p> Whether we watched it unfold on television from far, far away, or knelt in the ash-strewn streets of Manhattan, or lost someone we loved in the fireball at the Pentagon or in the field in Pennsylvania, it is a universal touchstone of horror and violation.<i>Catastrophe.</i></p> <p>C. S. Lewis said that in every human story, as in divine history, there are two catastrophes. The first is utter ruin: the catastrophe of disintegration and undoing, the end of life as we know it, light extinguished and death&#x2019;s dark triumph. The crucifixion. </p> <p>The second is the good catastrophe: the reintegrating and remaking, new hope rising out of the ashes&#x2014;the good that would otherwise not be. The resurrection.</p> <p>Both catastrophes dwell in the unsought stories of September 11. We cannot begin to do them justice. We cannot capture the horror of evil&#x2019;s fiery day. </p> <p>Nor can we adequately portray the triumph of hope: every candle lit in a nation whose heart was broken, every selfless act of service to those who were hurt and bereaved, every pint of blood given, every fragile tie of community restored where it once was not. </p> <p>Like the unity of the heroes of Flight 93, who made sure their plane plunged into a Pennsylvania field rather than through the White House or the Capitol dome. They said farewell to their families on the phones. They prayed the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer and the Twenty-third Psalm, their hoarse voices rising together in the shadow of death. And then they took a last deep breath and rushed the plane&#x2019;s long aisle to the end&#x2014;in order to save others. </p> <p>Just as we cannot do justice to September 11, we could not begin to detail all the ways that churches across our nation lived their faith in its wake. In the darkest hour, so many of the people of God stood as His church, doing what the church does best: <i>being</i> the community that brings hope and comfort to brokenness and pain.</p> <p>Think of that New York homeless shelter, a beacon for the weary and burdened, where cups of cool water were offered in Jesus&#x2019; name. Or of the churches that helped widows and orphans in their distress . . . the essence of &#x201c;true religion,&#x201d; as the book of James says. Or of the communities of believers gathering together in homes and churches across that great city&#x2014;singing praises to God, bringing their pain to Jesus, and drawing their grieving neighbors to the love of Christ.</p><p> </p><p>Think, too, of the service at Washington&#x2019;s National Cathedral a few days after the disaster. Government leaders, foreign dignitaries, and four ex-presidents gathered for an extraordinary service of remembrance. </p> <p>Speaking with humility and power, Billy Graham laid out the gospel. &#x201c;This cruel plot,&#x201d; he said, leads us to &#x201c;confess our need for God. We&#x2019;ve always needed God . . . many who died [in the attacks] are in heaven right now. They wouldn&#x2019;t want to come back. . . . Each of us must realize our own spiritual need. . . . The cross tells us that God understands our sin and suffering. He took it upon Himself. And from the cross, God declares, &#x2018;I love you!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>Billy Graham went on to challenge Americans to use this terrible calamity as a wake-up call to focus on the reality of the hope of the gospel. Hope for the present, that this be a time of spiritual revival, and hope for the future&#x2014;&#x201c;not just for this life, but for heaven and the life to come.&#x201d;</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, networks carried profoundly moving memorial services for those heroes&#x2014;firefighters, police, and ordinary citizens&#x2014;who died in the tragedy. Life as usual was no more, and millions of Americans went about their daily tasks with a thoughtful reverence born of brokenness. </p> <p>Complacency&#x2014;the greatest enemy of spiritual vigor in the West&#x2014;had been shattered by the catastrophes of life and death, good and evil, hope and despair. Churches filled across our nation, as thousands of people realized&#x2014;or subconsciously <i>sensed</i>&#x2014;that the terrorist attacks of 2001 had actually changed everything.</p> <p>In 1992, the year <i>The Body </i> was originally published, professor of public policy Dr. Francis Fukyama published <i>The End of History and the Last Man</i>. It became a bestseller, voicing the exhilarating hope of the times: The Berlin Wall had fallen, the Iron Curtain had rusted away, the Soviet Union had crumbled, the Cold War was over. The world as we had known it had changed, and America, to its exuberant surprise, found itself the lone remaining superpower: King of the World. </p> <p><i>The End of History </i>became standard fodder for commentators and op-ed writers, its ideas trickling down to the masses. It was an irresistibly seductive notion: Western liberal democracy had won the great ideological struggle of the twentieth century. Communism and fascism had been vanquished. A new era of enlightenment had dawned. Defense budgets were slashed, fueling the great economic boom of the nineties. Nothing could now derail a future of peace and prosperity, with America and its ideas reigning throughout the planet. </p> <p>Had human nature indeed been transformed and evil banished? </p> <p>Any such utopian hopes collapsed the day the Twin Towers fell. </p> <p>Perhaps a more prescient prophet of the twenty-first century was Harvard professor emeritus Samuel Huntington, who in 1996 wrote <i>The Clash of Civilizations</i>. Huntington&#x2019;s controversial book posited that the world is divided along the lines of the great religious civilizations: those states comprising the Eastern religions in one bloc, the Judeo-Christian West in another, and yet another being the scattered nations of Islam, which form a belt around the globe&#x2019;s girth from Nigeria in the west, eastward to Indonesia. The great confrontation, predicted Huntington, would be between the Muslim world and the West, a clash that Huntington said Islam will win.</p> <p>While we challenge Huntington&#x2019;s ultimate conclusion, his analysis was prophetic. Many Christians did not see the coming confrontation between Islam and the West; we were distracted by the simmering culture wars between Judeo-Christian tradition and the aggressive forces of secular naturalism. </p> <p>Then 9-11 jolted us to the reality of another, more chilling front in the war of world-views. While the culture war, for the most part, is conducted with clever words in Hollywood, on Capitol Hill, and in newspaper editorials, this new war of world-views is literal. It is waged with bombs and hijackings and murderous annihilation.</p> <p>Islam is intrinsically a militant religion, which, if true to its own doctrine, expands by force. Some moderate Muslims say the term jihad, which literally means struggle, is used <i>figuratively</i> as a picture of the individual&#x2019;s struggle to achieve holiness. That is doubtless so for millions of Muslims. Yet it was during an intense time of local wars that Mohammed, seeking to unite his people against aggressors, wrote of jihads. Many scholars believe that he meant it quite literally; indeed, the new religion Mohammed founded soon vanquished its enemies by the sword. </p> <p>Some Muslims still follow that paradigm today, including terrorist cells scattered throughout the world. This is why those who have been privy to classified information, like former CIA Director Jim Woolsley, believe that we are in the middle of World War IV. (The Cold War was World War III.) That&#x2019;s a harsh thought; it pierces any complacent visions of the end of history.</p> <p>Any who question the seriousness of the confrontation with radical Islam should examine the differences between its world-view and Christianity&#x2019;s. </p> <p>First, consider their respective views of human nature. The Muslim believes that human beings are inherently good, that all that hinders paradise is the failure to advance Islam, and that once it is fulfilled (by whatever means), there will be peace and happiness. </p> <p> What militant Muslims seek, therefore, is no different than what Hitler and the Marxists desired: Give us power and we will usher in the perfect state, the super race, or the workers&#x2019; paradise. The greatest horrors of the twentieth century were perpetrated by utopians, who always suppress liberty (usually with bloodshed) because they will, by force if necessary, put their views of what is good ahead of your right to determine that for yourself. </p> <p>The Judeo-Christian world-view believes that human beings are sinful people who need individual redemption and the continuing restraints of law and culture. (As G. K. Chesterton said, this doctrine of original sin is the only philosophy validated by thousands of years of recorded human history.) Paradise is not achieved by anything we can do&#x2014;spiritually, politically, or otherwise&#x2014;but by the gift of God. </p> <p>Second, Islam is a theocracy. The Koran is the law, and under that law, those of other faiths cannot truly exercise full rights of citizenship. This is why Christians are not allowed to practice their faith, even in private, in Saudi Arabia&#x2014;and why in most Islamic states, people other than Muslims cannot hold office and indeed in some places must pay extra taxes. There is intense persecution of Christians in many Muslim states like Sudan, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Pakistan.</p> <p>While secular elites in the West carp about religious groups (usually meaning Christians) &#x201c;imposing their view on others&#x201d; (as if we could) or chipping away at the proverbial &#x201c;wall of separation between church and state,&#x201d; nothing in our experience is even remotely close to theocracy.</p> <p>In reality, the democratic ideal of the West&#x2014;one that is not understood by those who seek to banish religiously informed values from public life&#x2014;is genuine pluralism. This is the religious freedom and healthy tolerance that respect people&#x2019;s unalienable rights&#x2014;not just Christians&#x2019;&#x2014;to pursue and practice their religious beliefs. As for religious persecution, it is noteworthy that the West came to the aid of Bosnian Muslims against their Serb oppressors, who were largely Orthodox Christians in name.</p> <p>Third, the Koran&#x2019;s view is that Allah rules by his will, with no assurance of ultimate redemption for his followers&#x2014;unless a Muslim dies as a martyr in a jihad to repel the infidels. Hence the seemingly endless supply of suicide bombers. For most Muslims, any hope of redemption lies in being able after death to walk across the sword of judgment, being pronounced by his or her deeds as acceptable to Allah. On the other hand, the God of the Bible is the deity of such supreme love that He sent His Son to die a substitutionary atoning death for all who believe. He <i>promises </i>heaven&#x2014;not for good deeds, and surely not for the murders of opponents, but by the extravagant gift of His grace for those who put their trust in Him.</p> <p>This leads to yet another major difference. Islam rejects the Trinity, saying it is the worship of three gods and is thus blasphemy to Allah. Muslim students on American campuses today are handing out tracts showing a diagram of three separate gods&#x2014;Christianity&#x2019;s fundamental heresy, they say.</p> <p>But for the Christian, difficult as the mystery of the Trinity may be, it goes to the heart of our belief. God the Father and Creator, Jesus the Redeemer and the Word become flesh, and the Holy Spirit the Sustainer are one essence. The same God who made us sacrificed Himself to save us and lives in us by His Spirit. </p> <p>Finally, Islam advances inevitably by force as it achieves power in each state. This is why militant Muslims are fomenting unrest and violence around the globe. They must, if consistent with their own beliefs, seek political power. But the Christian gospel, by definition, advances in the world only as God&#x2019;s love is extended, people are redeemed by Christ, and by His Spirit believers perpetuate His good in the world around them. </p> <p>This sketch is brief, but it highlights the fundamental differences between Islam and Christianity. No one who understands these distinctions can be sanguine about the clash of civilizations. Two immense belief systems are contending for influence and for the advancement of their beliefs&#x2014;and their basic suppositions are fundamentally at odds.</p> <p>Thus we cannot accept the mushy civic religious ecumenism that sprouted after September 11. In the many religious services that followed the tragedy, organizers scrupulously gave equal billing to all faith groups. The nation received a massive dose of politically correct sensitivity training&#x2014;and it stuck. Polls showed that Americans&#x2019; respect for Islam actually <i>increased</i> after September 11.</p> <p>President Bush, understandably anxious to reach out to moderate Muslim governments and to avoid a backlash against Arab Americans, hosted the first dinner ever held at the White House for Muslim clerics. Other politicians were equally sensitive; appropriately so, considering the volatile circumstances. After all, the politician&#x2019;s role is different from the pastor&#x2019;s.</p> <p>But some pastors evidently didn&#x2019;t make that distinction. Muslim imams not only appeared at interfaith services, but also spoke from pulpits in some Christian churches. And incredibly, a poll showed that nearly 50 percent of highly committed evangelical Protestants agreed with the statement that many religions can lead to eternal life.</p> <p>It is important not to inflame a difficult situation or trigger a reaction against Muslims in this country, the overwhelming majority of whom are surely patriotic, peace-loving Americans. But it is also crucial for Christians not to blur the clear differences between our beliefs. How can we contend for Christian truth if we don&#x2019;t know the distinctives of our faith or why the truth claims of other world-views fall short? Our case must, of course, be made in a loving manner; that&#x2019;s a given. But being loving doesn&#x2019;t mean ignoring truth. </p> <p>In fact, if we follow Jesus, we will love Muslims so much that sharing the love of Christ with them is the most natural thing we can do. This is more important now than ever, for thoughtful, peace-loving Muslims should find terrorist violence abhorrent. Is this, then, not a good time to introduce them to the love of the Christ, who died and was bodily raised from the dead, and to the promise that their sins can actually be forgiven and that they can have the <i>assurance</i> of paradise with Christ forever?</p> <p>I have found that Muslims respond to this message, particularly the historicity of the resurrection. Once, during a trip to visit with Prison Fellowship India volunteers and workers, I was invited to address a Christian Businessmen&#x2019;s evangelistic luncheon in Bombay. It was a particularly sensitive time in India. Several missionaries had had their visas revoked, and a former Indian president had issued a public warning against Christians who were seeking political power. </p> <p>Four hundred businessmen, about half in Western dress, the other in traditional Nehru jackets, gathered for the luncheon in one of the city&#x2019;s luxury hotels. I described my own conversion to them in detail. Then I talked about why my experiences in the White House and Watergate had convinced me of the historicity of the resurrection of Christ. </p> <p>Many decisions for Christ were made during that luncheon, and a long line of peop...</p></p><h2>Voice Disorders, Third Edition</h2><p><b>The Most Comprehensive Educational Print and Online Resource on Voice Disorders for SLPs!</b><p> With <i>Voice Disorders, Third Edition</i>, authors Christine Sapienza, PhD and Bari Hoffman Ruddy, PhD have created a comprehensive package for learning.

Surprisingly, despite the rich ethical questions it raises, very little philosophical attention has been paid to questions raised by captivity. <br><br>Though conditions of captivity vary widely for humans and for other animals, there are common ethical themes that imprisonment raises, including the value of liberty, the nature of autonomy, the meaning of dignity, and the impact of routine confinement on physical and psychological well-being. This volume brings together scholars, scientists, and sanctuary workers to address in fifteen new essays the ethical issues captivity raises. Section One contains chapters written by those with expert knowledge about particular conditions of captivity and includes discussion of how captivity is experienced by dogs, whales and dolphins, elephants, chimpanzees, rabbits, formerly farmed animals, and human prisoners. Section Two contains chapters by philosophers and social theorists that reflect on the social, political, and ethical issues raised by captivity, including discussions about confinement, domestication, captive breeding for conservation, the work of moral repair, dignity and an ethics of sight, and the role that coercion plays.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lori Gruen </strong>is Professor of Philosophy, Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Environmental Studies at Wesleyan University where she also coordinates Wesleyan Animal Studies and directs the Ethics in Society Project.

Instead of the ambush, skirmish, or single combat between heroes, the Greeks of the classical age devised a ferocious, brutal, brief, and very destructive form of combat that used armed men of all ages. With this technique, they invented the central act of Western warfare--the decisive infantry battle.<br> In this bold and original study, Victor Davis Hanson presents a new interpretation of Greek warfare and what took place on the battlefield. He argues that the same concept that shaped democracy--an unequivocal, instant resolution to dispute--also spawned the horrific nature of hoplite phalanx battles, and that Western culture may have learned the wrong lessons from them.<br> <em>The Western Way of War</em> draws from an extraordinary range of sources--Greek poetry, drama, and vase painting, as well as historical records--to fashion the first dramatic narrative of the actual mechanics of classical Greek warfare. Approaching his subject from the vantage point of the infantryman, Hanson explores everything from the brutal spear-thrusting and shield-pushing in the phalanx, and the difficulty of fighting in bronze armor, to the mass panic and hysteria. He describes the physical condition and age of the men and their commanders, their weapons, their capabilities, their spirit and morale, and their wounds; and covers the social and political aspects of the soldier's experience, revealing how profoundly the simple, brief, and brutal misery of infantry battle defined a man's entire relationship with his family, his community, and his country.<br> Hanson's compelling account of what happened on the killing fields of the ancient Greeks raises new issues and questions old assumptions about the <em>raison d'�tre</em> for war.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Victor Davis Hanson</strong> is Professor of Classical Languages and coordinator of the Classical Studies Program at California State University in Fresno.

Broad in perspective and flexibly arranged, it integrates the basics with recent developments in other areas and provides a feeling for the excitement being generated by recent research on fishes.<p> Ichthyology has traditionally emphasized the systematics, anatomy, and distribution of fishes. In the past, most prominent names associated with the field made their major contributions in these areas. Today, however, people who study fish have more far-reaching interests. They study fish to find ways to improve fisheries or aquaculture, to determine the effects of human activities on aquatic environments, and to test ideas in rapidly developing fields, such as ecology, physiology, behavior, and evolution. Growing numbers of sophisticated amateur ichthyologists desire to increase their understanding of fish they keep in aquaria or of those they pursue with hook and line. Regardless of why fish are studied, those studying them still need the basic vocabulary and understanding of fish biology that traditional areas of emphasis provide and that are found in this book, integrated with recent developments in other areas. Our goal is to provide some feeling for the excitement engendered by recent research on fishes. We also want to promote a sense of urgency for the need to protect fishes and aquatic ecosystems. It is critical that a high diversity of fishes continue to be around to fascinate future generations. </p> <p> In large part, this book is designed to serve as a text in classes on fish biology. The large number of chapters and the cross-references within chapters provide instructors of such courses with flexibility when assigning readings in the text. The students we had in mind while writing were junior- and senior-level university students. Our goal, however, is also to provide a useful and palatable summary of recent developments in ichthyology for individuals who have been away from the college classroom for some time and for anyone else who wants an introduction to the most numerous, diverse, and fascinating of all vertebrate groups. </p> <p> This book would not have been possible without the encouragement and help of many people. Initial stimulation and support in fish biology was provided by John B. Moyle, Evelyn W. Moyle, and James C. Underhill (to PB.M.) and by Donald E. Wohlschlag (to J.J.C.). Gary D. Grossman, Donald M. Baltz, and Robert A. Daniels were especially helpful in developing the first versions of many chapters. Numerous graduate and undergraduate students contributed valuable comments on various chapters and/or helped to keep our research programs going while we devoted time to writing.

Berra kindly shared with us their photographs and illustrations of curious fishes. Marjorie Kirkman-Iverson and the staff of our department assisted us in many ways&#x2014;but especially by keeping the departmental office running efficiently, making it much easier to accomplish our regular duties while the book was in progress. Finally, we are exceedingly grateful to our wives, Marilyn Moyle and Mary Cech, for permitting our marriages to survive and even grow stronger during the many hours over the years we have worked on fish, and to our now-grown children, Petrea and Noah Moyle and Scott and Gregor Cech, for continuing to accept us despite our sometimes obsessive interest in fish. </p> <p> The following reviewers were generous in providing comments and criticism of various editions of the book: Gary J.

Taking an argument from Plato and subjecting it to detailed (and very clear) analysis, Wittgenstein shows his understanding of how the sequence and function of differing parts of a highly-complex argument can be broken down and assessed. In so doing, he reaches a logical position of simultaneous agreement and disagreement with Plato&#x2019;s philosophical position. </p> <p><em>Philosophical Investigations</em> is also a powerful example of the skill of interpretation. Philosophical problems often arise from confusions in the use of language &#x2013; and the way to solve these problems, Wittgenstein posits, is by clarifying language use. He argues that philosophers must study ordinary uses of language and examine how people use it as a tool in their everyday lives. In this highly-interpretative way, the meaning of a word or sentence becomes relative to the context (people, culture, community) in which it is used. Rather than debate abstract problems, Wittgenstein urges philosophers to concern themselves with ordinary life and the concrete situations in which humans find themselves.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr Michael O&#x2019;Sullivan</strong> is a tutor in the Department of Philosophy, King&#x2019;s College London.

Watching <i>Henry IV</i> as a young boy, Norwich asked, where did history stop and drama begin? It is this question that <i>Shakespeare's Kings</i> seeks to answer, as it chronicles the historical events of the reigns of the monarchs of England dramatized in Shakespeare's plays. Beginning with <i>Edward III</i>, Norwich details the turbulent reign of Richard II, the rise of Henry IV, and the triumphs of <i>Henry V</i>, the disastrous reign of <i>Henry VI</i>, the Wars of the Roses, the evil of <i>Richard III</i>, and the painful birth of the Tudor monarchy.<p> Norwich sheds interesting light on what Shakespeare did with his sources (particularly Holinshed), as he provides chapters that detail the history of a particular monarch, which is then tested against Shakespeare's play of that particular king. This throws up some interesting points, such as the fact that the great nationalist John of Gaunt in Richard II was actually a deeply unpopular, patrician figure. The book also contains some wonderful illustrations and excellent tables of family trees, maps and an appendix that offers the entirety of <i>Edward III</i>, only recently (and still controversially) accepted into the canon by Shakespeare scholars.</p><p> However, the general reader should also treat Norwich's claim to historical objectivity with some caution. <i>Shakespeare's Kings</i> is almost completely ignorant of recent critical and historical studies of Shakespeare and historical studies of the monarchs under consideration. Norwich argues that Shakespeare would never have claimed historical accuracy--and to establish just how close he came has been one of the principal purposes of this book--because he was a dramatist, not a historian.

At that time we used to refer to the first years of this period as the 'springtime,' meaning a social and political awakening. For my generation, these years also coincided with our own personal springtime, in the sense that we were all in our youthful twenties. And both of these springtimes, as well as the image of our carefree Black Sea capital with acacias growing along its steep banks, are interwoven in my memory with the story of one family in which there were five children: Marusya, Marko, Lika, Serezha, and Torik."&#x2015;from <i>The Five</i></p><p><i>The Five</i> is an captivating novel of the decadent fin-de-si�cle written by Vladimir Jabotinsky (1880&#x2013;1940), a controversial leader in the Zionist movement whose literary talents, until now, have largely gone unrecognized by Western readers. The author deftly paints a picture of Russia's decay and decline&#x2015;a world permeated with sexuality, mystery, and intrigue. Michael R. Katz has crafted the first English-language translation of this important novel, which was written in Russian in 1935 and published a year later in Paris under the title <i>Pyatero</i>.</p><p>The book is Jabotinsky's elegaic paean to the Odessa of his youth, a place that no longer exists. It tells the story of an upper-middle-class Jewish family, the Milgroms, at the turn of the century. It follows five siblings as they change, mature, and come to accept their places in a rapidly evolving world. With flashes of humor, Jabotinsky captures the ferment of the time as reflected in political, social, artistic, and spiritual developments. He depicts with nostalgia the excitement of life in old Odessa and comments poignantly on the failure of the dream of Jewish assimilation within the Russian empire.</p></p><p>"This lyrical, in places almost sentimental, novel of turn-of-the-twentieth-century upper-middle-class Jewish life and its intertwining with the rest of that extraordinary cosmopolitan Russian port-city of Odessa, by the famously hard-bitten, extremist-Zionist, Vladimir Jabotinsky. radical founder of the Irgun and maker of much trouble for British-occupied Palestine, adds a dimension of meaning to a city also vividly portrayed in the better-known stories of Isaac Babel and the memoirs of Konstantin Paustovsky. Michael Katz's supple, readable translation brings this almost forgotten Russian novel back to life, adding it to what we can now call the "Odessa text" of Russian Literature."&#x2014;Sidney Monas, University of Texas at Austin <p>"Vladimir Jabotinsky is best known for his fiery, uncompromising politics but he was a supple, vivid writer of Russian non-fiction and fiction, and The Five is, undoubtedly, his greatest narrative achievement. It is a sensitive and evocative treatment of a little-remembered, but crucial slice of late imperial Russian Jewish life and, above all, a love story in which the city of Odessa itself is the prime protagonist."&#x2014;Steven J. Zipperstein, Koshland Professor in Jewish Culture and History, Stanford University </p><p>"Seldom has love for a society blended so poignantly with augury of its demise as in this marvelous novel about Odessa Jews at the beginning of the twentieth century.

With David Boyd, he is cotranslating the novels of Mieko Kawakami.</p>&#x201c;Mishima is famous both for writing and for dying. Or, strictly, for attempting hara-kiri. Perhaps surprising, then, is that Star is about shooting a blockbuster: not an Ozu or a Mizoguchi but a cheap Yakuza flick. Mishima himself starred in <em>Afraid to Die</em>, <em>Yukoku</em>, <em>Black Lizard</em>, and <em>Hitokiri</em> and knew first-hand his subject the vapidity of fame. Startling, is its lack of artifice: yielding grace from pulp.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Oscar Mardell, <em>3:AM Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This 1961 novel is finally getting the translation it has so long deserved. The psychologically complex story of Rikio Mizuno, young star of a series of gangster films, is based in part on Mishima&#x2019;s own experiences as an actor.

Death-haunted and contemptuous, <em>Star</em> is a sneering "up yours" to celebrity and fanaticism depicted in panoramic decadence &#x2015; though, notably, nowhere is its critique more biting than when gazing at its own fractured reflection. A rain-slick melodrama dripping with bored excess, this is a pocket guide for the sexy and disaffected.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Powell's Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mishima&#x2019;s ethereal 1961 novel, published for the first time in English, showcases the strains of fame on a young movie star.

Included are writings (many never before translated or reprinted) by artists, designers, architects, and critics, along with Dorra's learned commentary. Fifty photographs of symbolist works complement his encyclopedic coverage.<br><br>Dorra traces symbolism and its roots from artist to artist and critic to critic from the 1860s to the early twentieth century. The decorative arts and architecture are examined as well as painting and sculpture. The Arts and Crafts movement, art nouveau, the work of Eiffel in France and Sullivan in the United States are all well represented.<br><br>The close relations between symbolist poets and artists are reflected in the chapter on literary developments. Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, and Mallarm� are here, but so, too, are writers less well-known. A section on the Post-Impressionists and the "Artists of the Soul" rounds out Dorra's rich and varied text, and his epilogue lays the groundwork for what was to follow symbolism.<br><br>Dorra beautifully integrates the different aesthetic branches of symbolism, the different media and national variations, without ever losing sight of the whole. The historical context provided makes this a particularly appealing collection for students and scholars of art history and literature, as well as for anyone interested in the evolution of symbolism.</p><p>"In the misty domain of Symbolism, Dorra's anthology of source material offers the student the most lucid of guidebooks. Spanning more than half a century, from 1850 to 1918, its broad vista puts into fresh perspective the ambitions of the most diverse artists, architects, poets, and theorists, from Rossetti to Fry, Verlaine to Munch, Eiffel to Apollinaire."&#x2015;Robert Rosenblum, New York University<br><br>"This long-awaited anthology expands the parameters of Symbolist discourse. The carefully selected and annotated texts provide clear insight into a Symbolist vocabulary that had considerable impact on future generations. <i>Symbolist Art Theories</i> has deep resonance for an age transfixed by textual interpretation."&#x2015;Gabriel P. Weisberg, author of <i>Beyond Impressionism</i><br><br>"Dorra's impeccable scholarship is matched by the insight that relates the fragments. The book is of great value not only for students of symbolism, but for all those interested in the early history of modern art and art theory."&#x2015;George Mauner, Pennsylvania State University<b>Henri Dorra</b> is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the author of numerous books and articles on art and art criticism.</p><h2>10 Steps to Successful Strategic Planning</h2><p>Loaded with worksheets, exercises, tips, tools, checklists, and other easy-to-use and interactive learning aids, this book walks you through the process from beginning to end.

He uncovers new and controversial information about the role of the US' occupation forces in military controlled prostitution, as well as the subsequent "cover-up" of the existence of such a policy. This groundbreaking book asks why US occupation forces did little to help the women, and argues that military authorities organised prostitution to prevent the widespread incidence of GI rape of Japanese women, and to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.</p></p><p>Yuki Tanaka is at Keiwa College in Japan and is the co-author of Hidden Horrors:Japanese War Crimes in World War II (1995).<p><strong>'One of the achievements of this volume is that it successfully personalises some of the 'comfort' women.

With these shimmering, pulsating color masses, Rothko stressed that he had not removed the human figure but rather put symbols or shapes in its place. These intense color forms contained all the tragedy of the human condition. At the same time, Rothko explicitly empowered the viewer in the expressive potential of his work.

Auden, poet and critic, will conduct a course on Shakespeare at the New School for Social Research beginning Wednesday. Mr. Auden has announced that in his course . . . he proposes to read all Shakespeare's plays in chronological order." <i>The New York Times</i> reported this item on September 27, 1946, giving notice of a rare opportunity to hear one of the century's great poets comment on one of the greatest poets of all time. Published here for the first time, these lectures now make Auden's thoughts on Shakespeare available widely.</p><br><p> Painstakingly reconstructed by Arthur Kirsch from the notes of students who attended, primarily Alan Ansen, who became Auden's secretary and friend, the lectures afford remarkable insights into Shakespeare's plays as well as the sonnets.</p><br><p> A remarkable lecturer, Auden could inspire his listeners to great feats of recall and dictation. Consequently, the poet's unique voice, often down to the precise details of his phrasing, speaks clearly and eloquently throughout this volume. In these lectures, we hear Auden alluding to authors from Homer, Dante, and St. Augustine to Kierkegaard, Ibsen, and T. S. Eliot, drawing upon the full range of European literature and opera, and referring to the day's newspapers and magazines, movies and cartoons. The result is an extended instance of the "live conversation" that Auden believed criticism to be. Notably a conversation between Auden's capacious thought and the work of Shakespeare, these lectures are also a prelude to many ideas developed in Auden's later prose--a prose in which, one critic has remarked, "all the artists of the past are alive and talking among themselves."</p><br><p> Reflecting the twentieth-century poet's lifelong engagement with the crowning masterpieces of English literature, these lectures add immeasurably to both our understanding of Auden and our appreciation of Shakespeare.</p></p><p>After transplanting himself from England to the United States in 1939, W.H. Auden immediately became a kind of academic knight-errant, teaching at five different schools in as many years. Little evidence survives of most of these gigs. But in 1946, Auden gave a course on Shakespeare at Manhattan's New School, and luckily, several of the students attending took maniacally assiduous notes. Now Arthur Kirsch has collated the whole batch--and, one assumes, done some major nip-and-tuck work on this textual nightmare. The result is an insightful, eccentric, and perhaps essential slice of Bardolatry, which tells us as much about Auden as his subject.<p> Nobody can accuse Auden of parroting the party line on this greatest of English writers. In one of the nuttier moments in the lecture series, in fact, he expressed his distaste for <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> by declining to say a word about it--instead he simply played a recording of Verdi's <i>Falstaff</i> for the perplexed audience. Elsewhere his tendency was to view Shakespeare's creations as flesh-and-blood characters rather than poetic constructs: "If Antony and Cleopatra have a more tragic fate than we do, that is because they are far more successful than we are, not because they are essentially different." He's harder pressed to locate any success stories in <i>Julius Ceasar</i>: the protagonist strikes him as a fading despot, Octavius is "a very cold fish," and Cassius "a choleric man--a General Patton." And sometimes, as in this discussion of Falstaff's role in the double-decker <i>Henry IV</i>, Auden spins off his own freestanding riffs, which amount to short prose poems on Shakespearean themes: </p><blockquote> A fat man looks like a cross between a very young child and a pregnant mother. The Greeks thought of Narcissus as a slender youth, but I think they were wrong. I see him as a middle-aged man with a corporation, for, however ashamed he may be of displaying it in public, in private a man with a belly loves it dearly--it may be an unprepossessing child to look at, but he's borne it all by himself. </blockquote> Auden would return to the Bard's terrain many times in his career, most notably in "The Sea and the Mirror." But for sheer penetration and puckish humor, <i>Lectures on Shakespeare</i> is hard to beat, and demonstrates that for all their differences, both the speaker and his subject had a crucial thing in common--what Auden calls "a fabulously good taste for words." <i>--James Marcus</i><p>"What Auden has to say about Shakepeare's plays is almost always interesting, for two reasons. First, he knows how to praise or dissent, and to do so with much originality; secondly, he speaks of the ideas that were shaping his own thought and work at this important moment in his career, so that this book is as much a contribution to our understanding of Auden as it is to our appreciation of Shakespeare. It is beautifully edited and should interest all readers of Shakespeare and all admirers of Auden."<b>--Frank Kermode</b></p><p>"Auden's lectures on Shakespeare are a marvelous blend of steady, patient intelligence and stunning insight--spirited, free-thinking, resourceful, unintimidated, liberated from the air of treacly piety, and very, very intelligent."<b>--Stephen Greenblatt</b></p></p><h2>One-Handed Basket Weaving: Poems on the Theme of Work</h2><p>The poetry of the medieval Persian sage Rumi combines lyrical beauty with spiritual profundity, a sense of rapture, and acute awareness of human suffering in ways that speak directly to contemporary audiences. <br><br>Trained in Sufism�&#x20ac;&#x201d;a mystic tradition within Islam�&#x20ac;&#x201d;Rumi founded the Sufi order known to us as the Whirling Dervishes, who use dance and music as part of their spiritual devotion. Many of Rumi�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s poems speak of a yearning for ecstatic union with the divine Beloved. But his images bring the sacred and the earthy together in startling ways, describing divine love in vividly human terms. <br><br> This volume draws on a wide variety of translations�&#x20ac;&#x201d;from the early twentieth century to the present�&#x20ac;&#x201d;of Rumi�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s deeply moving, sensually vibrant poetry.</p><p>1 Cassette - 1 HourThe selections in this book are taken from Rumi&#39;s epic poem &#34;Masnavi&#34;.

In many cases, a quicker, more accessible, and more economical alternative is needed to guide these candidates in managing projects successfully the first time. </p> <p>The <em>Absolute Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to Project Management, Second Edition</em>, is intended to provide this alternative with a helpful, fun, and informative style. </p> <p><b>About This Book</b></p> <p>Let&#x2019;s review the objectives and approach of this book.</p> <p><b>Objectives</b></p> <p>The objectives of this book include the following: </p> <ul> <li>To be an easy-to-use tutorial and reference resource for any person managing their first project(s).</li> <li>To teach the key concepts and fundamentals behind project management techniques. If these are understood, they can be applied effectively independent of toolset, environment, or industry.</li> <li>To reduce the &#x201c;on-the-job&#x201d; learning curve by sharing the traits of successful projects and &#x201c;lessons learned&#x201d; from less-than-successful projects.</li> <li>To balance the breadth of topics covered with adequate depth in specific areas to best prepare a new project manager.</li> <li>To review the skills and qualities of effective project managers.</li> <li>To emphasize the importance of project &#x201c;leadership&#x201d; versus just project &#x201c;management.&#x201d;</li> </ul> <p><b>Approach</b></p> <p>Consistent with the <em>Absolute Beginner&#x2019;s Guide</em> series, this book uses a teaching style to review the essential techniques and skills needed to successfully manage a project. By teaching style, we intend the following: </p> <ul> <li>A mentoring, coaching style.</li> <li>A fun, easy-to-read, practical style. </li> <li>Assumes that the reader does not have previous hands-on experience with project management.</li> <li>Teaches the material as if an instructor were physically present.</li> <li>Task-oriented, logically ordered, self-contained lessons (chapters) that can be read and comprehended in a short period of time (15&#x2013;30 minutes).</li> <li>Emphasis on understanding the principle behind the technique or practice.</li> <li>Teaches the material independent of specific tools and methodologies.</li> <li>Teaches the material with the assumption that the reader does not have access to organizational templates or methodologies.</li> <li>Provides a summary map of the main ideas covered at the end of each chapter. Research has shown that this type of &#x201c;mind-map&#x201d; approach can drive better memory recollection when compared to traditional linear summary approaches.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p> <b>Out-of-Scope -</b> The scope of this book is clearly outlined in the table of contents, but as we will cover later, it is always good to review what is out of scope to ensure understanding of the scope boundaries. Because the field of project management is extremely broad, and we needed to draw the line somewhere, this book focuses on the proper management of a single project. As a result, the following advanced project management subjects are not covered in this book:</p> <ul> <li>Program management </li> <li>Enterprise portfolio management</li> <li>Enterprise resource management</li> <li>Advanced project risk management topics</li> <li>Advanced project quality management topics</li> <li>Advanced project procurement management topics</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p><b>Who Should Read This Book?</b></p> <p>The Absolute Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to Project Management, Second Edition, is recommended for any person who fits into one or more of the following categories:</p> <ul> <li>Individuals unsatisfied with other introductory project management books</li> <li>Individuals new to project management, such as</li> <ul> <li>Technologists </li> <li>Knowledge workers</li> <li>Students</li> <li>Functional managers</li> </ul> <li>Professionals taking a first project management assignment, such as</li> <ul> <li>Team leaders</li> <li>Project coordinators</li> <li>Project administrators</li> <li>Project support</li> <li>Functional managers</li> </ul> <li>Experienced project managers needing a refresher course</li> <li>Experienced project managers with limited formal project management education</li> </ul> <p><b>How This Book Is Organized</b></p> <p>This book has been divided into five parts:</p> <ul> <li>Part I, &#x201c;Project Management Jumpstart,&#x201d; sets up the general framework for our project management discussion and accelerates your project management learning curve, including an insightful review of successful projects and project managers.</li> <li>Part II, &#x201c;Project Planning,&#x201d; reviews the processes that establish the foundation for your project.</li> <li>Part III, &#x201c;Project Control,&#x201d; reviews the processes that allow you to effectively monitor, track, correct, and protect your project&#x2019;s performance.</li> <li>Part IV, &#x201c;Project Execution,&#x201d; reviews the key leadership and people-focused skills that you need to meet today&#x2019;s business demands.</li> <li>Part V, &#x201c;Accelerating the Learning Curve...Even More,&#x201d; provides experienced insights and tips on making better use of MS Project, managing specific real-life project situations, and on many hot project management topics to further accelerate the knowledge base and skill level of the new project manager.</li> </ul> <p><b>Conventions Used in This Book</b></p> <ul> <li>At the beginning of each chapter, you&#x2019;ll find a quick overview of the major topics that will be expounded upon as you read through the material that follows.</li> <li>The end of each chapter provides a list of key points along with a visual summary map.</li> <li>You will also find several special sidebars used throughout this book:</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p> <b>Note -</b> These boxes highlight specific learning points or provide supporting information to the current topic.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p> <b>Tip -</b> These boxes highlight specific techniques or recommendations that could be helpful to most project managers.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p> <b>Caution -</b> These boxes highlight specific warnings that a project manager should be aware of.</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

It establishes Barbara Jeanne Fields as a major historian of the American South, for she has provided new boundaries for understanding the relationship between race and class and she has contributed greatly to our overall understanding of the political economy of slavery."&#x2014;Nan Elizabeth Woodruff, <i>Journal of Social History<br></i>"[A] perceptive and provocative book.... Students of slavery and of the South cannot afford to overlook it."&#x2014;Daniel C. Littlefield, <i>American Historical Review<br></i>"Writing in a clear, spirited style, Fields probes the relationships between slaves and free blacks, between slaveholders and nonslaveholders, and between Maryland&#x2019;s conflicting sections."&#x2014;<i>Choice<br></i>"A stunning achievement.... The book is must reading for those with a special interest in the nineteenth-century South; those with a general interest in the development of capitalist relations of production will also not want to miss it."&#x2014;Joseph P.

Based on the first three-volume edition of 1882, the novel contrasts two love affairs, each involving an aristocrat and a commoner. Trollope vividly evokes the dull working lives, plain homes, blank streets, and limited horizons of the dwellers in Paradise Row, using them as an ironic choric commentary on the unattainable world of rank, wealth, and freedom, symbolized by life in the great country houses.</p><p>Anthony Trollope (24 April 1815 &#x2013; 6 December 1882) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Among his best-loved works is a series of novels collectively known as the Chronicles of Barsetshire, which revolves around the imaginary county of Barsetshire. He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters. Trollope's literary reputation dipped somewhat during the last years of his life, but he regained the esteem of critics by the mid-twentieth century.</p><h2>Managing to Collaborate: The Theory and Practice of Collaborative Advantage</h2><p><p>Collaboration between organizations on different continents can raise issues of economic development, health, the environment, risk sharing, supply chain efficiency and human resource management. It is an activity that can touch upon almost every aspect of business and social life. In this notable text, the authors combine rigorous theory with practical examples to create a useful, practical, one-stop resource covering topics such as:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>the principles of the theory of collaborative advantage</li> <li>managing aims&nbsp;</li> <li>membership structures and dynamics&nbsp;</li> <li>issues of identity</li> <li>using the theory.</li></ul> <p></p> <p>The key features of the book include rich theory, drawn directly from practice, explained in simple language, and a coherently developed understanding of the challenges of collaboration, based on careful research.

Born in a New York tenement, humble in manner, Salk had all the makings of a twentieth-century icon--a knight in a white coat. In the wake of his achievement, he received a staggering number of awards and honors; for years his name ranked with Gandhi and Churchill on lists of the most revered people. And yet the one group whose adulation he craved--the scientific community--remained ominously silent. "The worst tragedy that could have befallen me was my success," Salk later said. "I knew right away that I was through--cast out." <br><br>In the first complete biography of Jonas Salk, Charlotte DeCroes Jacobs unravels Salk's story to reveal an unconventional scientist and a misunderstood and vulnerable man. Despite his incredible success in developing the polio vaccine, Salk was ostracized by his fellow scientists, who accused him of failing to give proper credit to other researchers and scorned his taste for media attention. Even before success catapulted him into the limelight, Salk was an inscrutable man disliked by many of his peers. Driven by an intense desire to aid mankind, he was initially oblivious and eventually resigned to the personal cost--as well as the costs suffered by his family and friends. And yet Salk remained, in the eyes of the public, an adored hero. <br><br>Based on hundreds of personal interviews and unprecedented access to Salk's sealed archives, Jacobs' biography offers the most complete picture of this complicated figure. Salk's story has never been fully told; until now, his role in preventing polio has overshadowed his part in co-developing the first influenza vaccine, his effort to meld the sciences and humanities in the magnificent Salk Institute, and his pioneering work on AIDS. A vivid and intimate portrait, this will become the standard work on the remarkable life of Jonas Salk.<br></p><p><br><strong>Charlotte D. Jacobs</strong>, M.D. is the Ben and A.

All questions are formatted as clinical vignettes that resemble the types of questions students encounter on the examination at the end of the clerkship and on the USMLE licensing examination. Each question has a detailed answer critique that identifies the correct answer, an explanation of why that answer is correct and the other options are incorrect, an educational objective and a short bibliography. Succinct Key Points summarize the important take home messages for each question. <i>MKSAP for Students 5<i> is supported by its companion textbook, <i>Internal Medicine Essentials for Students<i> All questions in <i>MKSAP for Students<i> are associated with relevant content in the Essentials textbook that can directly answer the question.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p><p></p><h2>Electronics</h2><p><p> <b> </b>The book provides a wealth of readily accessible information on basic electronics for electrical and computer engineering. <b> </b>The introduction and treatment of external amplifier characteristics has been condensed into the first chapter, op amps are treated in a single chapter, and treatment of device physics has been shortened and appears in various chapters on an as-needed basis. <b> </b>For anyone who wants an introduction to electronics. </p></p><p>Preface <p> This book is intended for use in the core electronics courses for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering majors. The book frequently takes the designer's point of view in discussing circuits, illustrates design with numerous examples, shows how to test circuit designs using SPICE, and provides numerous open-ended design problems with which students can practice. </p><p> WHAT'S NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION </p><p> The entire book has been reorganized and rewritten with an eye toward reducing its length and making it more student friendly. Integrated-circuit techniques are treated earlier and receive greater emphasis throughout. The needs of computer-engineering students are addressed by treating the switching behavior of devices early in the book, adding a chapter on CMOS logic circuits, and adding a discussion of data converters. Several motivational examples are provided in the "Anatomy of a Design" sections as asides from the main text to show how interesting circuits can be designed using the material learned to that point in the book. For example just after the chapters on op-amps and diodes, the design of a function generator is illustrated. The introduction and the treatment of external amplifier characteristics have been condensed into the first chapter. MOSFETs are emphasized over JFETs. Op-amps are treated in a single chapter. The treatment of device physics has been shortened and appears in the various chapters on an as needed basis. The chapter on SPICE has been eliminated because most students learn to use SPICE in their circuits courses. </p><p> ASSUMED BACKGROUND AND LEVEL OF PRESENTATION </p><p> The background assumed is a first course in circuit analysis. In the beginning, the level of presentation is appropriate for an introductory core course. Starting with Chapter 7, the level gradually increases to that appropriate for juniors having a stronger interest in the subject. Circuit analysis by Laplace transform methods is helpful (but not required) background for frequency response and compensation of feedback amplifiers in Chapter 9. </p><p> INSTRUCTIONAL AIDS </p><p> A website located at prenhall/hambley contains a number of resources for instructors and students including: Answers to selected end-of-chapter problems PDF files of key figures from the book that can be used to make transparency masters Schematic files for the circuits discussed in the book Schematic files that are the answers to Exercises that call for SPICE analysis A selection of links to manufacturers' sites where additional data may be downloaded </p><p> A solutions manual containing complete solutions for the exercises and problems is available to instructors who adopt the textbook for classroom use.

More than enough material is provided for a two-semester (or three-quarter) course sequence, allowing topic selection suited to the interests of the instructor and students. </p><p> Chapter 1 contains an overview of electronics and treats the external characteristics of amplifiers. The first several sections acquaint students with the big picture and illustrate how the details studied in this book fit into that picture. Usually, I assign this material for reading but don't spend class time on it. Next, we introduce basic amplifier concepts including gain, input resistance, output resistance, frequency response, and circuit models for amplifiers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of differential amplifiers, setting the stage for op-amps. </p><p> Chapter 2 treats operational amplifier circuits including basic amplifiers, imperfections of op-amps, integrators, and differentiators. The discussion of amplifiers gives immediate application for the concepts (that were introduced in Chapter 1) of gain, input resistance, output resistance, and ideal amplifier types. </p><p> Chapter 3 treats diodes and diode circuits, including load lines, ideal diodes, rectifiers, wave shapers, logic circuits, voltage regulators, device physics, and switching behavior. The small-signal-equivalent-circuit concept is introduced in Section 3.8 setting the stage for BJT and FET amplifier analysis. </p><p> "Anatomy of a Circuit Design: A Function Generator" is set aside from the main text and appears between Chapters 3 and 4. It shows students how the material from the first three chapters can be used in designing a useful and interesting circuit. </p><p> Chapter 4 covers BJT characteristics, load-line analysis, large-signal models, biasing, small-signal equivalent circuit analysis, the common-emitter amplifier, the emitter follower, and use of the BJT as a switch in logic circuits. </p><p> Chapter 5 contains a similar treatment of FETs with the main emphasis on MOSFETs. If desired, the order of Chapters 5 and 6 can be reversed with little difficulty. </p><p> "Anatomy of a Circuit Design: A Multistage Amplifier" appears immediately after chapter 5 and illustrates how a multistage amplifier can be designed using what was learned from Chapters 4 and 5. </p><p>Chapter 6 treats digital logic circuits with very strong emphasis on CMOS. Basic logic circuit concepts, the resistor-pull-up NMOS inverter, the CMOS inverter, propagation delay, NOR and NAND gates, dynamic logic, and transmission gates are covered. Differential and multistage integrated amplifiers including IC bias techniques are treated in Chapter 7. </p><p> Chapter 8 covers amplifier frequency response, including the Miller effect, the BJT hybrid model, and common amplifier configurations. </p><p> Chapter 9 examines feedback and oscillators. Sections 9.1 through 9.4 deal with types of feedback and their effects on gain and impedances. Then several design examples are given in Section 9.5. Sections 9.6 through 9.9 treat transient response, frequency response, and compensation of feedback amplifiers. Several examples of feedback amplifiers are discussed in Section 9.10. Finally, oscillator principles are discussed in Sections 9.11 and 9.12. </p><p> "Anatomy of a Circuit Design: A Cardiac Pacemaker" appears after Chapter 9 and shows an interesting application of many of the circuits and concepts discussed in the book. </p><p> Output stages and power supplies are presented in Chapter 10 including thermal considerations, power devices, Class A and B amplifiers, linear voltage regulators, and power-supply design. </p><p> Chapter 11 treats active filters, tuned circuits, impedance-matching networks, LC oscillators, and crystal oscillators. </p><p> Chapter 12 considers comparators, timer circuits and data converters, including the Schmitt trigger, multivibrator circuits, the 555 timer IC, digital-to-analog converters, and analog-to-digital converters. </p><p> Finally, "Anatomy of a Circuit Design: A Precision AC to DC Converter," illustrates another practical design using many of the concepts treated earlier in the book. </p><p> CHAPTER DEPENDENCY </p><p> The first five chapters form the foundation upon which the remainder of the book rests. The order of coverage of the remaining chapters is extremely flexible. Chapter 5 on MOSFETs can be covered before Chapter 4 on BJTs if desired. </p><p> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> I wish to acknowledge my many friends at Michigan Technological University, ASEE, and elsewhere who gave help and encouragement in writing this text.

And yet, we have less contact with green space now than ever, and our stress and anxiety levels are at an all-time high. The Secret Therapy of Trees helps us rediscover the restorative value of our natural environment and presents the science behind green therapies like forest bathing and bioenergetic landscapes, explaining which are the most effective and how to put them into practice to achieve the best possible results. <br><br>Studies have shown that increased exposure to green space can result in a regulated heartbeat, lowered blood pressure, reduced aggressiveness, improved memory skills and cognitive function, and a healthier immune system. Just one visit to a forest can bring positive effects (hint: monoterpenes, the natural essential oils in plants, have numerous positive effects on health), and even a mindful walk through a semi natural park can alleviate physical and psychological stress. <br><br>With multiple studies backing its findings and thorough explanations for each technique, The Secret Therapy of Trees is a treasure trove of tips on how to harness the regenerative power of plants and reconnect with our planet's natural spaces, bringing us health and happiness. <br><br>You'll also discover:<br>* Which plants purify the environment at home and in the office<br>* The benefits of negative ions and where to find them<br>* How to recharge through contact with trees</p><p>MARCO MENCAGLI has a degree in agronomy and has been working in the field for over twenty-five years.

Not exactly breaking news. Life moves on regardless . . . maybe not exactly how we would like, but it does.</p><p>Unfortunately, this mind-set minimizes the problem at hand. We like nature, we know it&#x2019;s important for our well-being, but we don&#x2019;t give it a central role in our lives. This is a generalization, of course. Even in today&#x2019;s hypertechnological world, some of us think and act differently. In fact, there are young people who are returning to rural life, an indication of the trend toward ecological and environmental sensitivity. Still, they are the minority.</p><p>In 2009, the world&#x2019;s population surpassed 6.8 million: that was the year in which, for the first time, city dwellers outnumbered rural residents, an occurrence that the Worldwatch Institute had predicted for 2008. Demographers have shown that this trend will continue to rise. The latest forecasts hypothesize that by the year 2030 approximately 75 percent of the world&#x2019;s population will live in urban areas.</p><p>While Europe and North America have already reached this percentage, the rest of the world is racing to urbanize. There are at least twenty (or twice that, if greater metropolitan areas are considered) world megalopoli, cities with over ten million inhabitants, at least two of which are in Africa.</p><p>It&#x2019;s time to start examining how our relationship to nature has been affected in light of this societal shift, instead of passively accepting our circumstances. At the root of our substantial indifference to this situation, as we must acknowledge, is a certain desire not to know. It&#x2019;s similar to the attitude many have toward events of vast social significance: when faced with issues we find too difficult, we prefer to hand the problem to someone else. But leaving the decision up to others could have disastrous consequences.</p><p>Some people, for example, provocatively assert that all this attention on environmental issues and humanity&#x2019;s relationship to nature is just a fad. Others believe we should establish a new bond with the natural world: something more technical, more geared toward extracting benefits based on cause and effect, where nature becomes a tool (not to say a consumer product) for self-improvement. We respectfully disagree: something inside us, a little voice, tells us that can&#x2019;t be right. But what is the source of that voice? Perhaps it&#x2019;s the part of us that conserves the historic (or rather, genetic) memory of who we are and where we come from.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s where we should start.</p><p>For a very long time, natural environments have been our habitat, or, to be more precise, our home. At first, we were humble occupants, then we resolved to become ambitious dominators. Here are some facts to consider--the genus Homo has existed on Earth for 2.3 to 2.4 million years, according to the latest anthropological studies. And the more &#x201c;human&#x201d; variant of the genus Homo, the one that most resembles us, has been given an age of approximately 1 million years, more or less coinciding with the time that they learned to use fire.</p><p>The species Homo sapiens formed just under two hundred thousand years ago on the continent of Africa, the same place where their ancestors-predecessors originated. When Homo sapiens appeared, Homo erectus also existed in Asia, and Homo neanderthalensis in Europe. Homo erectus went extinct soon thereafter, while we know that at least forty to fifty thousand years ago Sapiens encountered--and for a short time lived alongside--Neanderthals, before the latter went extinct in turn.</p><p>After their appearance on the planet, Sapiens briefly remained in their place of origin, Africa, but within a hundred thousand years they had colonized the Middle East and from there moved onto other lands: Southeast Asia, Europe, Oceania, and America.</p><p>For a very long time, the first representatives of the Homo genus were gatherers and then hunters, living off what nature was able to offer more or less spontaneously. The shift to agricultural society, which happened gradually, was unique to Homo sapiens. In fact, the first &#x201c;professional&#x201d; farmers emerged just eleven thousand years ago. Once human beings began devoting themselves to agriculture, their dwellings shifted from the forests. After all, hunter-gatherer villages contained only a few dozen people, while those of a farming society could easily exceed a hundred. These new communities required more space.</p><p>The first true cities, with hundreds of inhabitants, arose just over eight thousand years ago. (It is estimated that the world&#x2019;s population at the time was no more than seven to eight million--a very modest number compared with, for example, the buffalo population then living on the North American plains.) Over the course of the next eight thousand years, the rise in urban population essentially never saw a downturn.</p><p>These few figures are enough to establish with some certainty that--as the beginning of the agricultural age ushered in the definitive retreat from the forests and savannas--man as a species has spent 99.5 percent of his evolutionary time in completely natural environments. Even today, a portion of the world&#x2019;s population spends their entire existence there. Perhaps a bit loosely, we &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; humans tend to define these environments as &#x201c;green space,&#x201d; sometimes imprecisely alongside the expression &#x201c;untouched by man.&#x201d; Let us remember, however, that our species lived in these places--and only in these places--up until, in relation to the entire history of our species, what amounts to a few moments ago.</p><p>It is therefore possible that our own evolutionary history is what drives us to love green spaces, even in the context of contemporary living. There are several fascinating examples that illustrate this theory, on both the emotional and behavioral level.</p><p>Our Unbreakable Bond with Nature</p><p>The scientific community is still unable to definitively determine how many colors the human eye can perceive. Various biomedical reports show numbers ranging from a minimum of 100,000 to a theoretical maximum of 10 million shades. Yet there is a consensus (and study results) that green is the color for which humans can distinguish the greatest number of shades. The difference is significant: for green it&#x2019;s about 100 hues, while for other colors, including composite colors, it&#x2019;s only a few dozen. This phenomenon has evolutionary origins.</p><p>Green is the most common color in nature, as it is the typical pigment color of chlorophyll, which is present in all primitive and evolved plant species that use the process of photosynthesis. The ancestors of Homo sapiens, certainly not one of the strongest mammals on the planet physically, quickly learned to discern the various shades of green in vegetation, deciphering the elements of the surrounding environment in order to increase their chances of survival. This behavioral adaptation translated into a morphological and physiological adaptation of our &#x201c;warning system&#x201d;: an imprint of nature that has remained with us up to the present.</p><p>Even more surprising are the differences between reaction times at the sudden appearance of an animal or a moving object, such as a car. Recent studies conducted at the University of California, Santa Barbara, have shown that those who live in urban environments, no doubt more used to navigating the dangers of traffic and moving vehicles, demonstrate much shorter reaction times at the sight of an animal than an automobile suddenly appearing in their field of vision.</p><p>Equally noted are the several experiments conducted on small children who had never been exposed to potentially dangerous animals such as spiders or snakes. Even if the children couldn&#x2019;t understand the threat from a cognitive perspective, they showed a physiological response to the stress of merely viewing images of such animals.&nbsp;</p><p>Analogous experiments have been conducted using sophisticated camouflage techniques to show adults images of potentially dangerous animals (like spiders) in rapid succession interspersed with neutral objects, such as flowers and mushrooms, so that the subject did not consciously perceive the stimuli. Electroencephalograms regularly registered stress responses at the sight of the threatening stimuli, a sign that &#x201c;ancient fears&#x201d; are well rooted in the subconscious and show greater resistance to repression than other modern threats, like guns or knives.</p><p>Similar studies focusing on our sense of hearing confirm that human beings register and decipher nature sounds differently than those connected with modern life. For example, one might assume that an alarm created by a rapid series of high-pitched sounds (typical for danger signals) would trigger an alert response very quickly. However, a study published in 2010 in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America demonstrated that people react fastest to the sounds of animal predators, like the lion, tiger, or jaguar, rather than to common artificial alarms. Of course, that doesn&#x2019;t mean that using a lion roar for a home security alarm would be more effective in deterring unwanted visitors, though it would be an interesting experiment.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, natural noises such as water flowing down a stream or birds chirping can mask our auditory perception of street traffic and other noises typical of urban environments. Indeed, the introduction of nature sounds seems to diminish the disturbance of artificial noises, especially in indoor work environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Humans, evidently, always prefer to hear sounds that come from nature.</p></p><h2>Acceptance and Change in Couple Therapy: A Therapist&#39;s Guide to Transforming Relationships (Norton Professional Books (Paperback))</h2><p><p><strong>An ideal text for all students of marital dynamics.<br></strong></p></p><p><p><strong>Andrew Christensen</strong> lives in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Neil S.

Zygmunt Bauman explores the silences found in debates about the Holocaust, and asks what the historical facts of the Holocaust tell us about the hidden capacities of present-day life. He finds great danger in such phenomena as the seductiveness of martyrdom; going to extremes in the name of safety; the insidious effects of tragic memory; and efficient, "scientific" implementation of the death penalty. Bauman writes, "Once the problem of the guilt of the Holocaust perpetrators has been by and large settled . . . the one big remaining question is the innocence of all the rest&#x2014;not the least the innocence of ourselves."Among the conditions that made the mass extermination of the Holocaust possible, according to Bauman, the most decisive factor was modernity itself. Bauman's provocative interpretation counters the tendency to reduce the Holocaust to an episode in Jewish history, or to one that cannot be repeated in the West precisely because of the progressive triumph of modern civilization. He demonstrates, rather, that we must understand the events of the Holocaust as deeply rooted in the very nature of modern society and in the central categories of modern social thought.</p><p>Sociology is concerned with modern society, but has never come to terms with one of the most distinctive and horrific aspects of modernity - the Holocaust. <p>The book examines what sociology can teach us about the Holocaust, but more particularly concentrates upon the lessons which the Holocaust has for sociology. Bauman's work demonstrates that the Holocaust has to be understood as deeply involved with the nature of modernity. There is nothing comparable to this work available in the sociological literature.</p>Zygmunt Bauman (1925-2017) was Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the Universities of Leeds and Warsaw. He is the author of many works including Legislators and Interpreters (Polity Press) and Modernity and Ambivalence (Polity Press). He was also awarded the Theodor W. Adorno Prize in 1998.</p><h2>High-Performance Ford Engine Parts Interchange (S-A Design)</h2><p>Covering both big and small Ford V8 engines, this first-ever book on the subject provides detailed information on factory high performance parts, interchangeability between Ford Windsor and Cleveland engines, extensive coverage of the 302 and 351 series, as well as 390 through 460 engines, factory casting numbers, cylinder heads, carburetor IDs, accessories, and more.</p><p>Understanding which engine parts can be exchanged with others in their respective &#x201c;families&#x201d; can aid a builder tremendously in the design phase of a rebuild project. What author George Reid has done for Ford enthusiasts is to research and collect a huge amount of this valuable information and organize it here in the High-Performance Ford Engine Parts Interchange. Several Ford V-8 engine families are represented, including the popular Windsor, Cleveland, FE, M, and 385-Series powerplants. With a nod toward high performance, Reid has also included information on the legendary Boss engines, and also some factory-crafted high-performance goodies and aftermarket components. Which engine blocks provide the best basis for a performance engine? Which cylinder heads can be teamed with these blocks? Which connecting rods should be sought out, and which should be avoided? These questions and countless others are all answered with confidence, backed by the author&#x2019;s many years of hands-on experience. All of the critical engine components, including the blocks, cylinder heads, and connecting rods, along with crankshafts, pistons, valvetrain, intake manifolds, carburetors, ignition systems, exhaust systems, and cooling systems are all covered in great detail. As a reference book, High-Performance Ford Engine Parts Interchange is invaluable&#x2015;it includes casting number data, date code information, and Ford ID tag decoding info. This book is a must-have for anyone planning to design and build a truly high-performance vintage Ford V-8 based on factory parts.George Reid has been a Ford enthusiast for more than 30 years.

The region is famous for its magnificent art--masks, totem poles, woven blankets--produced by the world&#39;s most politically and economically complex hunters and gatherers. As this pioneering account shows, the history of settlement on the Northwest Coast stretches back some 11,000 years. With the stabilization of sea levels and salmon runs after 4000 B.C., many of the region&#39;s salient features began to emerge. Salmon fishing supported rapid population growth to a peak over 1,000 years ago. The spread of rain forest made available trees such as red cedar that could be turned into vast houses and seaworthy canoes. Large households and permanent villages emerged alongside slavery and a hereditary nobility. Warfare became epidemic, initially hand to hand but later characterized by the development of fortresses and the bow and arrow. Art evolved from simple carvings and geometric designs 5,000 years ago to the specialized crafts of the modern era. Written by noted experts and profusely illustrated, this is an essential reference for scholars and students of Native American archaeology and anthropology as well as travelers to the region.</p><p>Kenneth Ames is Professor of Anthropology at Portland State University.

Initially deemed obscene in England and the USA, this richly-allusive novel, revolutionary in its Modernistic experimentalism, was hailed as a work of genius by W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway. Scandalously frank, wittily erudite, mercurially eloquent, resourcefully comic and generously humane, Ulysses offers the reader a life-changing experience.</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L. Ernst, who defended Ulysses during the trial.</p><h2>Logo, revised edition</h2><p>'The next time you are tempted to design a logo, take a look at this book. Chances are, it has already been done.

The text of the original has been revised throughout to take account of the enormous amount of new research following publication of the first edition. The introduction discusses the history of literacy up to the present day; the guide to further reading brings together over 300 new titles up to 1992. In this second edition there are substantially new sections on bureaucracy, sacred books, writing materials, the art of memory, ways of reading (particularly for women), the writing of French, and the relationship of script, imagery and seals.</p><p><b>Michael Clancy</b> taught Medieval History at Glasgow University 1964-85. He now researches at London University at the Institute of Historical Research, University Vollege London, and the Warburg Institute. He is the author of the popular textbook England and its Rulers 1066-1272, and Abelard-A Medieval Life.When Michael Clanchy&#x2019;s book From Memory to Written Record was first published in 1979, it was the most important book on English Royal administration in the middle ages that had appeared in a general.... The second edition takes full cognizance of the extensive literature on the subject of morality and literacy, which has been one of the half dozen most discussed aspects of the medieval European world during the past two decades. Clanchy has significantly deepened and enriched his classic study. It is indispensable for not only political, legal and socialhistorians, but also for students of medieval literature and religion. From Memory to Written Record is one of those seminal works that shape the direction of the next generation of historical and social thought. This second edition will remain of the major works on the medieval world for many decades to come. Norman F. Cantor, New York University<br> <p>Reviews of the first edition:<br> "A tour-de-force, a scholarly work which is genuinely hard to put down, and which breaks new ground in its approach." <i>Journal of Legal History</i><br> </p> <p>"Thought-provoking and wide-ranging . . . one can assert confidently that it is one of the most exciting books on medieval English history to appear in recent years." <i>History</i><br> </p> <p>"Many familiar assumptions about the medieval world will have to be reconsidered in the light of this book. It is impossible to convey its range or the variety of its implications, but it is possible to insist on its importance." <i>History Today</i><br> </p> <p>"Clanchy's work will stand as a remarkable piece of scholarship and as a massive contribution to our understanding of the medieval world." <i>Journal of Library History</i></p></p><h2>A Cultural History of India</h2><p>This book, edited by the well-known historian A.

Ember</b> started at Antioch College as a chemistry major. She began taking social science courses because some were required, but she soon found herself intrigued. There were lots of questions without answers, and she became excited about the possibility of a research career in social science. She spent a year in graduate school at Cornell studying sociology before continuing on to Harvard, where she studied anthropology primarily with John and Beatrice Whiting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For her Ph.D. dissertation she worked among the Luo of Kenya. While there she noticed that many boys were assigned &#x201c;girls&#x2019; work,&#x201d; such as babysitting and household chores, because their mothers (who did most of the agriculture) did not have enough girls to help out. She decided to study the possible effects of task assignment on the social behavior of boys. Using systematic behavior observations, she compared girls, boys who did a great deal of girls&#x2019; work, and boys who did little such work. She found that boys assigned girls&#x2019; work were intermediate in many social behaviors, compared with the other boys and girls. Later, she did cross-cultural research on variation in marriage, family, descent groups, and war and peace, mainly in collaboration with Melvin Ember, whom she married in 1970. All of these cross-cultural studies tested theories on data for worldwide samples of societies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>From 1970 to 1996, she taught at Hunter College of the City University of New York. She has served as president of the Society of Cross-Cultural Research and was one of the directors of the Summer Institutes in Comparative Anthropological Research, which were funded by the National Science Foundation. From 1996 until 2009 she served as executive director of the Human Relations Area Files, Inc. (HRAF), a nonprofit research agency at Yale University. She was appointed President of HRAF in 2010. She is also currently Past-President of the Society for Anthropological Sciences. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After graduating from Columbia College, <b>Melvin Ember</b> went to Yale University for his Ph.D. His mentor at Yale was George Peter Murdock, an anthropologist who was instrumental in promoting cross-cultural research and building a full-text database on the cultures of the world to facilitate cross-cultural hypothesis testing. This database came to be known as the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) because it was originally sponsored by the Institute of Human Relations at Yale. Growing in annual installments and now distributed in electronic format, the HRAF database currently covers more than 410 cultures, past and present, all over the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Melvin Ember did fieldwork for his dissertation in American Samoa, where he conducted a comparison of three villages to study the effects of commercialization on political life. In addition, he did research on descent groups and how they changed with the increase of buying and selling. His cross-cultural studies focused originally on variation in marital residence and descent groups. He has also done cross-cultural research on the relationship between economic and political development, the origin and extension of the incest taboo, the causes of polygyny, and how archaeological correlates of social customs can help us draw inferences about the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After four years of research at the National Institute of Mental Health, he taught at Antioch College and then Hunter College of the City University of New York. He has served as president of the Society for Cross-Cultural Research. From 1987 until his death in 2009, he was president of HRAF. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Peter N. Peregrine</b> came to anthropology after completing an undergraduate degree in English. He found anthropology&#x2019;s social scientific approach to understanding humans more appealing than the humanistic approach he had learned as an English major. He undertook an ethnohistorical study of the relationship between Jesuit missionaries and Native American peoples for his master&#x2019;s degree and realized that he needed to study archaeology to understand the cultural interactions experienced by Native Americans prior to contact with the Jesuits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While working on his PhD at Purdue University, Peter Peregrine did research on the prehistoric Mississippian cultures of the eastern United States. He found that interactions between groups were common and had been shaping Native American cultures for centuries. Native Americans approached contact with the Jesuits simply as another in a long string of intercultural exchanges. He also found that relatively little research had been done on Native American interactions and decided that comparative research was a good place to begin examining the topic. In 1990, he participated in the Summer Institute in Comparative Anthropological Research, where he met Carol R. Ember and Melvin Ember/</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Peter Peregrine is professor of anthropology at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin and external professor at the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He also serves as research associate for the Human Relations Area Files. He continues to do archaeological research, and to teach anthropology and archaeology to undergraduate students.</p></p>
